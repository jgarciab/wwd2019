    "`It's the year 2084. It was ten years ago that GoogleZero became elected president of the United States and invaded Poland. Luckily, in our country, Amazonian PrimeDrones are still loyal to the Republic of the Netherlands, and are forcing the invador back. In an attempt to weaken us, GoogleZero has realeased the cholera bacteria. This bacteria was eliminated in 2048, and all our research on the topic was in Google Drive, and thus in the hands of the enemy. Fortunately, all American companies are still banned in North Korea, and Kim Ju-ae has a copy of some old research , and some that the spy Klemens stole for them. This research (in the data folder) shows some relationship between the resistance to cholera and calcium levels.`\n",
