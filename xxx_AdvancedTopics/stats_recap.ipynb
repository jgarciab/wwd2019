    "    - As a rule of thumb the variance of the group with highest variance shouldn't be greater than 4 times the variance of the group with lowest variance.\n",
    "- Step4: Do ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis (with two groups do t-test or MWU)\n",
    "- Step5: Do Tukey test if normality distributed and equal variance. Otherwise you can compare each pair of groups with MWU test (and the level of significance should be 0.05/number of comparisons)\n",
