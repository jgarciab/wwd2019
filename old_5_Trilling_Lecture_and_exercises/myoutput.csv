0,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>It is an honour to be here today to introduce the theme of 'recession and recovery'. If you will permit, I would like to suggest that this afternoon we focus more on recovery than on recession. I think we know enough about the recession side of the story.</p><p>It started with the fall of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008. I happened to be here, at the Blouin Creative Leadership Summit, only ten days later. Everyone was talking about the collapse of Lehman. They were shocked and alarmed. But even then we could hardly imagine that its impact would be so dramatic, so historic.</p><p>As we now know, this event triggered a global financial and economic crisis. Governments were forced to give cash injections running into billions to prevent an economic and financial meltdown. When credit dried up and demand fell, businesses struggled to keep their heads above water, and many went under. Ordinary people's jobs, homes and pensions were at risk.</p><p>The aftermath was high unemployment in the US and Europe: around ten per cent. And in many countries public finances were thrown completely out of balance.</p><p>The question now is: what can we do? What does the road to economic recovery look like? The road to a sustainable and balanced recovery, I should firmly add. Because only a sustainable and balanced recovery can prevent future imbalances in our economic system. Only a sustainable and balanced recovery will enable us to combine economic growth with measures to tackle other global challenges: to combat climate change, to maintain biodiversity, to fight international terrorism, to resolve migration issues and to find a response to the major shortages of natural resources - oil, gas, food and water.</p><p>There are two dimensions to this theme: short-term recovery, and measures to bring about a sustainable, long-term recovery.</p><p>Let us take a brief look at each dimension. The current debate on short-term recovery revolves around whether our vulnerable economies need further stimulus, or whether it is time for governments to withdraw because the private sector can once again play its natural role as the engine of economic growth.</p><p>Opinions on what we should do vary widely. I'm sure that applies to you too. And that is understandable. After all, there's no such thing as one truth or one answer. The differences between countries, or rather, between their citizens' behaviour, are simply too big.</p><p>For example, Dutch companies and citizens get uncomfortable if their government runs up an enormous debt and makes it bigger by continuing to spend regardless. If that happens, they keep a tight hold on the purse strings - companies invest less, and ordinary people save more. They are well aware that sooner or later they will pay the price for their government's runaway spending. In the form of higher taxes and higher contributions towards health care, education and pensions.</p><p>They will only start spending again in a climate of economic certainty and financial stability. In America things are different, as you probably know better than I do.</p><p>So this is why - in my country at least - I argue for budget discipline, reforms and a reduction of government deficits. In both the short and the long term.</p><p>I fully agree with Olivier Blanchard and Carlo Cottarelli - chief economist and head of fiscal affairs at the IMF - that we should not become obsessed with short-term policy. They recently wrote an article in the Financial Times entitled 'The great false choice, stimulus or austerity'. They conclude, and I quote, 'But more important are measures that improve the long-term fiscal outlook in those countries with high deficits and debt. This is where governments should focus their efforts. For without long-term fiscal reforms, lasting recovery is doomed far more certainly than if the world gets 2011 plans wrong by a fraction of a per cent of GDP.'</p><p>In other words, long-term measures are the surest route to sustainable recovery. So let us focus on these above all.</p><p>If you ask me what I think is crucial to make our world, our economies and our lives more stable, more sustainable and more dynamic in the future, I can sum up the answer in one word: values.</p><p>Two weeks ago, on the website of the The New York Times, I read an analysis by Thomas Friedman that struck a chord with me. Let me give you an idea of his central message. He wrote 'We had a values breakdown - a national epidemic of get-rich-quickism and something-for-nothingism. Wall Street may have been dealing the dope, but our lawmakers encouraged it. And far too many of us were happy to buy the dot-com and subprime crack for quick prosperity highs. […] China and India have been catching up to America not only via cheap labour and currencies. They are catching us because they now have free markets like we do, education like we do, access to capital and technology like we do, but, most importantly, values like our Greatest Generation had. That is, a willingness to postpone gratification, invest for the future, work harder than the next guy and hold their kids to the highest expectations. In a flat world where everyone has access to everything, values matter more than ever.'</p><p>Of course, we need to reform our economic, tax and financial systems to make them more robust and better able to withstand future challenges. For example, by raising our retirement age, making the labour market more flexible, and improving supervision in the financial sector. But a successful future demands another fundamental reform: a greater moral awareness. Globally. Nationally. In business and among ordinary people.</p><p>Let me outline what I mean.</p><p>Globally, I hope that we can further intensify our current international cooperation. In good times and bad. When the crisis was deepest, the G20 assumed a prominent role and declared itself the premier forum for economic cooperation. It certainly lived up to that promise, as I know from personal experience. It launched a framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth, which I applaud. But it is only a framework. What matters now is to fill in the detail, and to harmonise our policies in practice.</p><p>The G20 is still struggling with its ambition of truly sustainable and balanced growth. The issue of scarcity seems to have faded from view because of the crisis, but I predict that if the G20 ignores it, it will surely be back on the agenda in a few years. This is why I say: now is the time to take our moral responsibility. By taking concrete action to tackle climate change, for example. The climate summit in Cancun is an excellent opportunity to make real progress. </p><p>National governments also have their part to play. The lessons of this crisis are harsh. There are no two ways about it. We owe it to the next generation to introduce structural reforms. To exercise proper stewardship and put public finances back in order. To act now to address the problem of demographic ageing, so that our children are not left to sort it out. To ensure that the financial sector first and foremost serves the real economy, the business community and the general public.</p><p>Businesses have their own responsibility here. And I'm not only talking about banks. People who line their own pockets, excessive bonuses, perverse incentives, short-termism, reckless risk-taking: as we have seen - and still see, unfortunately - this kind of thing is not unique to the financial sector. </p><p>In my view, we can achieve sustainable recovery and growth only if businesses and business people behave more responsibly. If they go much further in embracing corporate social responsibility. Not because terms like 'green' or 'sustainable' or 'socially responsible' are good for their image and boost sales. But because they really do feel a long-term responsibility for the world in which they operate, and for their role in it.</p><p>And finally ourselves, ordinary citizens. We too will have to be guided more by moral principles in the future. By standards and values. The value of saving. The value of social engagement. The value of caring for others. These are the kind of values that - to use Friedman's words again - 'matter more than ever'. Without moral awareness there can be no sustainable recovery.</p><p>Let us continue resolutely on the road to recovery. Without running away from our responsibilities. Not in the short term, and certainly not in the long.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",10
1,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Today we are looking back at the ten years since the Millennium Development Goals were agreed. But we are also looking forward. We still have five years to go. Five years to make a difference for all those people for whom poverty, hunger and shortages are still everyday realities.</p><p>Looking back, we have good reason to be satisfied with what we have achieved in some areas in the past ten years. Poverty, child mortality and malaria have all been reduced. More girls are attending school. And more people have access to clean drinking water - a subject to which the Netherlands, and in particular our crown prince, are deeply committed.</p><p>At the same time, there is cause for concern. Because our aims are ambitious, but we are moving too slowly. That applies in particular to the MDGs on reducing maternal mortality and achieving equality between men and women. Progress is lagging far behind, and we cannot allow that to happen. So we will have to do better. And we can do better, if we are prepared to think and work outside the box.</p><p>Too often, the Millennium Development Goals are still seen as the sole responsibility of NGOs, governments and multilateral organisations. This is unwise, because the commitment of the private sector is crucial to achieving them. Its knowledge and expertise in fields such as science, logistics and innovation enable us to push forward boundaries in development. Above all, however, the private sector is both a source of and a stimulus to employment, sustainable development and economic growth.</p><p>Research shows that economic growth accounts for 80 per cent of poverty reduction in the world. When per capita income increases, the poorest 20 per cent of the population also benefit. And the higher the growth is and the longer it lasts, the faster poverty rates drop. The same free market principles also operate at grassroots level. We will speak about that later today, when I host a side-event on inclusive finance in the presence of Her Royal Highness Princess Máxima, the Secretary-General's Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development.</p><p>So we know that within certain parameters, the mechanisms of the free market are essential for development. But we also know that investing in developing countries is still regarded by many as a risky business. So to get economic growth in gear, the private sector needs a helping hand.</p><p>That is why the Dutch government is strongly in favour of public-private partnerships. We recently drafted a bilateral donors' statement in support of private sector partnerships for development. Rather than viewing the private sector merely as a cash dispenser, this statement recognises that it is an equal partner in development. We are in this together with the governments of Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US. The International Finance Corporation and UNDP are also involved.</p><p>The governments of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba strongly support this policy of working with the private sector to achieve the MDGs. The upcoming Netherlands Antilles MDG Report will not only emphasise this but also strengthen existing partnerships.</p><p>In a recent letter to co-facilitators, written jointly with the CEOs of several Dutch multinationals, the Dutch government emphasised the importance of innovative partnerships. I quote: </p><p>'The Netherlands believes that greater collaboration between government and business could be instrumental, as it would combine the knowledge and experience of the public sector with the creative solutions and technical expertise of the private sector.'</p><p> I am proud that so many Dutch companies are here at this week's summit to prove that our approach really works.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>To achieve the MDGs, innovative thinking is needed in every field. This applies in particular to MDG3 and MDG5. Every year, over 350,000 women are still dying during pregnancy or childbirth, and in many cases women are still being denied equal rights. Shortly before my departure for New York, I was presented with a petition signed by thousands of Dutch mothers who find it unacceptable that during this summit more than 4,400 women will die during pregnancy or childbirth.</p><p>Like these mothers, the Dutch government believes - and I believe - that equal rights and opportunities for women bring the achievement of most other MDGs closer. Burkina Faso is a good example. By addressing harmful practices and discrimination against women, by expanding and improving family planning services, by committing itself to removing obstacles to health care, this country was able to reduce the number of needless deaths substantially.</p><p>Human rights play a crucial role on the road to 2015. By ensuring equality and non-discrimination, we give the poorest and most vulnerable groups access to basic services. Accountability, the right to participation and freedom of information will enable our efforts to meet the real needs of the population. And making things accessible and affordable ensures that the MDGs are more than a short-term success.</p><p>The key, ladies and gentlemen, is that we combine our strengths and efforts. As members of the UN, as donors and developing countries, and especially as governments and businesses.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
2,"<p>Prime Minister Harper, Excellencies, honoured veterans, ladies and gentlemen, </p><p>He was seventeen years old. Private Stanley Colquhoun from Vancouver.He was seventeen when he fought in the Netherlands for freedom.Seventeen when he fought in the Battle of the Scheldt. And seventeen when he lost his life on Dutch soil in the cause of freedom. He was laid to rest here in Bergen op Zoom. This young Canadian made the supreme sacrifice. He gave his life. In the grimmest, fiercest and most savage battle fought by the Canadian army in the Second World War.</p><p>This is what one veteran said about conditions in 1944. 'We were always wet, always cold. The shelling never let up, the fighting just went on day after day. I thought it'd never end.' These words come from the book 'A terrible victory', the harrowing story of the Scheldt offensive. It was presented to me by the author Mark Zuehlke in Vancouver several months ago. At the presentation, I met two Canadian veterans who had been involved in the fighting and in the liberation of Zeeland. Their stories made a deep impression on me. I was born in 1956 in the same area where they had seen so much horror. I grew up there in safety, peace and security.</p><p>Today we remember how the Canadians and their allies struggled to bring peace and security to the Netherlands and the Dutch people. We are deeply grateful for the sacrifices they made. We admire their courage and their determination. And we are filled with respect for their sense of duty and responsibility.</p><p>Today we also remember the priceless gift they gave us: the gift of freedom. Sixty-five years ago, the Nazi occupiers were driven from our country. Sixty-five years ago despair and oppression made way for hope and promise. Sixty-five years ago the Netherlands was liberated.</p><p>Yesterday we celebrated our liberation with the war veterans. And, equally important, with thousands of Canadian students who are in the Netherlands this week to learn about the past. This week they will walk in the footsteps of their fellow Canadians. Canadians who were not much older than they are now when they fought a battle of life and death in 1944 and 1945. They will see where the frontline was, and where people lit bonfires to celebrate their liberation. They will hear about the courage of their fellow Canadians in the face of fear. They will feel the eternal gratitude of the Dutch people for the bravery of the Canadian solders.</p><p>It is essential that we pass on the torch of history to the next generation. That we continue to tell the story of war, and the story of peace. So that every day we feel in the very fibres of our being how precious our freedom is. How freedom cannot be taken for granted. And how freedom goes hand in hand with responsibility. The responsibility to cherish the gift of freedom and to pass it on. And the responsibility to remain alert to intolerance, to discrimination and to anything that threatens our freedom.</p><p>We owe it to him. To Stanley Colquhoun. And to the many thousands who fought for peace in the Netherlands. To those who fell, and those who survived. Our liberators. Our heroes. Forever.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
3,"<p>Ni hao pengyoumen, </p><p> Your Excellency, Professor Qin, </p><p> Professor Poppema, </p><p> Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Today, this already vibrant city is truly at the centre of the world, for the opening of the world Expo 2010 promises to be a great spectacle. I'm delighted to be here and I would like to thank Shanghai and China for inviting me. Today, the eyes of the world are on Shanghai. After the Olympic Games in 2008, this is the second time in a short period that China has been able to show its many strengths. You can be proud of what has been accomplished here so quickly, and I congratulate you.</p><p>Of course, I hope you will be able to pay a visit to the Dutch pavilion during the Expo. In the best 'Dutch Design' tradition, the building has turned out to be rather special. It is built in a figure of eight, the Chinese lucky number, which is also where it gets its name: Happy Street. In Happy Street you will see why the Expo's theme, 'Better City, Better Life', is a perfect choice for the densely-populated Netherlands. Our pavilion gives a sample of the best that the Netherlands has to offer - in spatial innovation and water management, for example, and also in areas like fashion and architecture. I highly recommend a visit.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, the 2010 World Expo is only the latest confirmation that China feels connected to the rest of the world and vice versa. And the latest proof that the world has become a global village, as also shown by the Centre for European Studies and the Dutch Studies Centre here at the prestigious Fudan University. For me it is a great honour and a pleasure to be able to speak to so many young Chinese people in this setting. For it is not only the past that binds us. It is also our common future.</p><p>And that is what I want to talk about today. About that common future. About the global village. And about the simple truth that the world cannot do without China, nor China without the world.</p><p>My speech today will be in two parts. First, I will look at the historical character and growing importance of our relationship. Then I will outline several important and topical items for our common future agenda. An agenda for a better life in the global village, and one that takes account of China's changing role and growing influence on the world stage.</p><p>But let me begin at the beginning, with the first Dutchman ever to set foot in China. His name was Dirck Gerritszoon Pomp and he arrived here in 1584. He was amazed by many aspects of your country. At the same time he also wrote that he had met 'very good people' here and described the Chinese as a 'brave' and 'sharp-witted' people. And he was also highly impressed with the rich variety of goods that China produced.</p><p>The Chinese also had a certain admiration for the Dutch from the very beginning - especially for their enterprising spirit. That shared characteristic gave us an immediate bond. Or, as the 18th-century Chinese saying goes, 'When it comes to doing business, all foreigners are blind, the Dutch have one eye and the Chinese have two.' Looking back down the centuries, I take that as a great compliment.</p><p>Between Pomp's pioneering visit and this year's Expo in Shanghai lies a long shared history. A history in which amazement at an unfamiliar land has given way to knowledge and mutual understanding, dialogue and friendship, and the realisation that our own interests and our shared interests are simply extensions of each other.</p><p>Particularly after China began to open up at the end of the 1970s, the political, economic and cultural ties between China and the Netherlands and Europe began to develop fast. In the 30 years since, China has been transformed from an inward-looking agricultural nation into the world's second-largest economy. A country with high-tech credentials and an open character. But the changes in Europe have been enormous too, with the introduction of the internal market and the European single currency, the euro.</p><p>To say that China and Europe have grown closer in this period would be an understatement. Something far more significant has happened: we have grown more intertwined. Let me give you a couple of figures that make clear how profoundly our relationship has changed in the past thirty years.</p><p>In 1975, there was almost no trade between China and Europe. Now it totals 450 billion US dollars a year, which makes Europe China's most important trading partner. It's also worth noting that after Germany, the Netherlands is China's largest European trading partner.</p><p>Let me give you another number: there are 20,000 European companies active in China today. And around 2,000 of those have Dutch origins. They include small and medium-sized enterprises, but also companies like TNT Group, whose 17,000 employees make it the largest Dutch employer in China.</p><p>And how about the 7,500 young Chinese men and women studying in the Netherlands at the moment? Several hundred of those are PhD students. In Europe as a whole there are now 200,000 Chinese students, and their contribution to our knowledge infrastructure is highly valued. It goes without saying that you, too, are very welcome at our universities.</p><p>What these and other figures show is that 1.3 billion Chinese and 500 million European citizens and consumers have become closely interconnected in the last thirty years. One of these great economies is the fastest-growing in the world. The other has the greatest purchasing power. In the interests of our common prosperity, I believe it is vital that we continue dealing with each other and working together.</p><p>The Netherlands will do whatever necessary to make this possible, exploiting its long internationalist tradition - both in trade and in outlook. It is a tradition based on idealism, but also on enlightened self-interest. The Netherlands has the sixteenth largest economy in the world and the ninth largest financial sector. After the United States it is the largest agricultural exporter on the planet. Such achievements would be unthinkable without foreign trade and solid international contacts. The Netherlands earns most of its income abroad. For centuries, we have relied on international trade for our prosperity and we have never forgotten it.</p><p>This tradition also accounts for the Netherlands' active standpoint in the multilateral and bilateral forums. The Netherlands is rightly seen not only as an international trading nation but also as a champion of human rights, poverty reduction and international security. We are convinced that global economic success goes hand-in-hand with being prepared to shoulder responsibility for the world of tomorrow in a range of different areas. In this way we can ensure that as many of the world's people as possible can share in the prosperity and quality of life we often take for granted. And in the end, we will all benefit. </p><p>That explains why the Netherlands' close relations with China go beyond economic matters. We are sharing knowledge and running joint programmes and projects in a variety of fields. I could mention our research partnerships on energy and agriculture. Or our cultural programmes. But I'm also thinking of human rights, of course, an issue we often discuss at both bilateral and European level. It is not always easy, and we certainly don't always agree. But it's an open discussion, as discussions between friends should be.</p><p>In my experience the dialogue on human rights and strengthening the rule of law has grown in value and meaning as the bond between our countries has grown closer. And it isn't just talk, either. The last time I visited Shanghai, in October 2008, I opened a new centre offering free legal advice to workers. The centre is part of a broader legal cooperation programme that includes training for lawyers and courses on prisoners' rights for prison officers.</p><p>This is the way cooperation should be. Open, honest, and always supportive, despite our differences of opinion. I'd like to quote a man for whom I have great respect: your Prime Minister, Wen Jiabao. Last year he gave an impressive speech at Cambridge University, in which he said, 'Different countries and nations need to respect, tolerate and learn from each other's cultures.' Naturally, I fully endorse his words. For tolerance, respect and a willingness to learn from each other are the foundations of any prospective partnership. And of course, any partnership is a two-way street.</p><p>Which brings me to the second part of my speech: how China, the Netherlands and Europe can develop a joint strategy to tackle a number of major global challenges. I believe we are reaching a turning point. In the space of a few decades your country has grown into a world economic power and its rise continues. The world is watching with respect and admiration. But this also creates expectations. As a well-known French proverb puts it: 'Noblesse oblige.' In other words, as China's economic importance increases, we look forward to seeing greater Chinese involvement on other issues. The Netherlands, and Europe as a whole, would like to work with you in these areas.</p><p>We need a common agenda for the future. There is a long list of items that it could include, but today I will focus on four that are highly topical. Non-proliferation, the role of the UN Human Rights Council, and sustainability are three of them. But let me begin with perhaps the most important: the international economic order after the crisis.</p><p>Against protectionism, for free trade </p><p> In the economic field in particular, China is taking on a greater role and cooperation is becoming more important. Although this is mainly due to China's rapid development, I believe that the crisis has acted as a catalyst. Old, existing fora like the G8 are quickly losing their relevance, while the G20 has risen to prominence in a short space of time. The Netherlands welcomes this development. For the crisis is above all an international crisis, and calls for international solutions. That is why as many key economies as possible need to be involved.</p><p>I am pleased to see that China and the Netherlands often take the same line in the G20, and I sincerely hope that this continues. After all, there is still a great deal to do, even if the worst of the crisis is behind us. Our agreements on improving financial supervision and tackling excessive bonuses must now be implemented. And perhaps even more important: we need to remain on our guard against protectionism, which could destroy the economic recovery that is now under way.</p><p>In fact, I believe we should step up our efforts in this area. After all, strengthening free trade is one of the best recipes for sustainable economic recovery. So it is high time we achieved a breakthrough in the Doha Development Round. It would be good if China and the EU could press for this in the World Trade Organisation. At the moment, a large number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements are being drawn up. The EU and China are also working on such an agreement. Although these are obviously no substitute for a broad WTO agreement, we need to be pragmatic. The most important thing is for China, the Netherlands and their trade partners to reap the benefits of having objective, common rules.</p><p>Non-proliferation </p><p> Another important area of cooperation is non-proliferation - an issue that is more urgent than ever. The spread of nuclear weapons poses a direct threat to global stability, so we have a common interest in opposing it. Three weeks ago I met your leaders at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington. We worked together effectively there on measures to secure nuclear material and prevent it from falling into terrorist hands.</p><p>There are two reasons why it is vital to step up cooperation in this field. The first is North Korea, and the second, Iran. The Netherlands highly values China's role in the six-party talks with North Korea in recent years. The present careful approach needs to continue. As far as Iran is concerned, China, Europe and the United States are currently engaged in intensive talks on tightening sanctions. I want to be very clear about this. Evasive tactics by Iran must not be rewarded. The Iranian regime must understand that developing nuclear weapons is a disastrous course, and that the world will not sit by and do nothing.</p><p>International human rights </p><p> The next point concerns the UN's Human Rights Council. This has the potential to be a crucial international forum for discussing and improving human rights in individual UN member states. I say 'potential', because unfortunately the Council does not yet adequately fulfil this role in practice.</p><p>This is partly due to disagreement about who is responsible for human rights: the international community or sovereign states? My own conviction is that freedom of expression and belief, and freedom from fear and want, are universal freedoms. Freedoms that must apply to all people at all times, as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As I said earlier, we are talking at bilateral level, and we're moving beyond words alone. We're working together where possible and seek to draw closer to each other. So I sincerely hope that China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, will work more closely with Europe on this issue. For the flagrant human rights violations in countries like Sudan and Burma must not be allowed to continue.</p><p>Sustainability and climate </p><p> The fourth item on our common agenda that I want to highlight is very different in nature: sustainability and climate change. Another urgent theme, for climate change affects us all. To be honest, the Netherlands and other European countries left the climate summit in Copenhagen with mixed feelings. We had hoped for firmer agreements on reduction targets. But we are pleased that a step has been taken towards a political agreement, and that a hundred and seven countries have now signed up, including China.</p><p>We clearly need to be pragmatic in preparing for the follow-up conference in Cancún. We must allow for the fact that different agendas are proceeding at different speeds. We now need to work on specific agreements in areas such as adaptation and technology. And these are precisely the areas in which China and the Netherlands have held similar positions for some time. Dutch government programmes fund various partnerships on sustainability between Chinese and Dutch companies and research institutes. And this is bearing fruit, for the number of joint projects is increasing rapidly and they cover a broad area, from water management and LED lighting to high-tech projects on solar and biomass energy. These projects reflect not only a growing recognition of the importance of corporate social responsibility, but also a healthy business instinct, for let us not forget that climate policy offers opportunities. Opportunities for innovation and jobs. Opportunities that we must seize together.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Today, Shanghai is at the centre of the world. A world that looks increasingly like a village, where people meet, get to know one another and understand one another. I spoke about this in the first part of my speech - the growing ties between China and the Netherlands and the rest of Europe. I believe that this has brought us great benefits and holds great promise for the future. </p><p>China has changed dramatically in the past thirty years, and has every reason to face the world with confidence. As China's economy grows, so too does its visibility on the world stage. We have touched on that too and also how that holds out a promise for the future. The promise of a better life in the global village. I hope I have made clear that the Netherlands and Europe hope to work with China in fulfilling that promise.</p><p>The next thirty years belong to students like yourselves. You will shortly take over the baton from the present generation of leaders, together with your peers in the Netherlands and the rest of Europe. It will be no easy task but, as Expo 2010 shows, you have a solid basis to build on. The Expo itself is the result of enormous creativity, expertise and energy and the will to work together to achieve something extraordinary. May this positive spirit inspire us all in the work that lies ahead.</p><p>Thank you. Or to end, as I began, in your own beautiful language: Xie Xie. </p>",12
4,"<p>Honoured veterans, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Today, the official funeral takes place of the 46 crew members of the Navy ship Cheonan. They and their families are in our thoughts today. As I expressed yesterday to President Lee, the Netherlands shares the sorrow and pain of the Korean people. This dreadful tragedy reminds us that serving the cause of peace and freedom often goes hand in hand with great danger and serious risk.</p><p>Being here at this cemetery today reminds us of that as well. Willi de Vries, a Dutch veteran of the Korean War, once said, 'Surely I will go to heaven when I die, for I have been in hell already.' He survived his deployment to Korea; 121 Dutch soldiers did not, and four have been missing ever since.</p><p>The stories of the men laid to rest in this cemetery testify to bad luck and incredible bravery. They are stories of soldiers fighting for freedom, whatever the circumstances. We remember Private Ketting Olivier, whose unit stormed the enemy position in the infamous battle of hill 325. He was the first inside, and he paid with his life. We also remember the leadership of Lieutenant-Colonel Den Ouden, who always led his men from the front and who died at Hoengseong. Their names are among the many who paid the ultimate price. We honour them, and we honour the ROKS, the Republic of Korea soldiers, who fought alongside them and shared their faith in the cause of freedom. When the free world asked for a sacrifice, these brave men were ready. It is now our obligation to remember and to honour their sacrifice.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>This year we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War. There is still no official peace, and the Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea is a scar that separates families from their loved ones, rich from poor, and democracy from dictatorship. I was there this morning and I want to say that I could feel the dark shadows of the past all around me.</p><p>This experience again underlines the importance of memorial services like today's. They focus our minds on the suffering caused by war and aggression, past and present. And they serve as a platform for involving young people in remembrance and keeping history alive.</p><p>So today we turn to the past and honour the victims from all the nations represented here. But we also voice our support for and gratitude to the men and women who have risked their lives since then to promote peace and security all over the world. We honour those who have defended freedom and justice in the past, and we honour those who do so today. These soldiers, who include Korean and Dutch troops, are not fighting for territory or spoils of war. They are fighting to protect those who need our protection, to help those who need our support and to bring peace where there is conflict.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>I would like to thank those who made today's remembrance ceremony possible. Thank you for offering us this peaceful location to remember our war victims and to reflect on the suffering caused by armed conflicts all over the world.</p><p>May I ask you to join me in one minute's silence to honour the memory of all the men, women and children who suffered and died in the Korean War and in memory of the 46 crew members of the Navy Ship Cheonan.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
5,"<p>President Han-Joong Kim, Dean Tae-Young Lee, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>It is a great privilege to be with you today at Yonsei University and to be awarded an honorary doctorate. I feel a bond with this distinguished institution. First, because Yonsei is a forward-looking and ambitious university. Your approach to the future is summed up in your motto, 'Yonsei, the First and the Best'. You can't put it any more clearly, and I like that. I also feel a bond with you because Yonsei University has been guided by Christian values for 125 years.</p><p>I see definite parallels with my own alma mater, the Free University, Amsterdam. It too is constantly looking for new perspectives. It too was founded in the late nineteenth century. And it too is deeply rooted in the Christian faith. I studied and obtained my doctorate at this university. For nine years, I served there as professor of Christian social thought on society and economics. </p><p>My whole life, in fact, has been shaped by the Christian social tradition. A tradition that binds people within a country, but also brings together countries spanning many time zones. Even two such different countries as the Republic of Korea and the Netherlands. I realised this back in 1997 when I was the co-supervisor of a Korean student who obtained a doctorate from the Dutch Theological University in Kampen for his thesis 'Market and Ethics'. His research explored the links between John Rawls's theory of economic justice, the socioeconomic thought of Dutch Protestantism and the economic realities in Korea. The author of this thesis was Mr Sang Won Lee. He is now Professor of Systematic Theology at Chongshin University, and he is also here today.</p><p>When I was preparing for this speech, Professor Lee, I had another look through your thesis, and was struck again by its originality and the strength of its argument. It is good to see you again after all these years.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>In my speech today I want to make a connection between tradition and the future. I want to show that Christian social thought is an excellent guide to tackling the issues facing our society, for both today and tomorrow. First, I will briefly outline the main features of Christian social thought. Then, I will look at three topical and closely related societal themes: international solidarity, the financial and economic crisis, and sustainable economic growth. I will explore how Christian social thought can help us address these themes. </p><p>But first a few words about Christian social thought itself. Its core premise is that people are called by God to live by His laws and take responsibility for their lives. This premise touches upon our public and private lives, and ethical questions, but also law-making, business and politics.</p><p>The concept of 'responsibility' plays a central role in Christian social thought. It has two dimensions. First, it relates to the way society is organised. How can we best assign duties and powers in our society? We are talking here, in other words, about the relationship between people, society, the market and government. The Christian social tradition favours a prominent role for responsible citizens and civil society organisations. If they can fulfil this role, the government can focus on its core tasks.</p><p>The second dimension of the concept of responsibility is concerned with the way people, organisations and institutions conduct themselves. Of course, you have a responsibility for yourself. But equally important is your responsibility towards others. Certainly if we want to live in a well-balanced, caring society. We can trace this back to the Biblical commandment to 'love your neighbour as yourself'. Man is a social being who only fully realises his potential by relating to others. By developing his talents for the benefit of others.</p><p>Starting from this basis, Christian social thought focuses on civil society, a subject on which Professor Kim Ho-Ki has done a lot of research. In his article 'Civil Society in South Korea: retrospect and prospect', he writes of the 'explosion of civil society movements in South Korea since the late 1980s'. I think this is a crucial development. After all, a society is more than the sum of a market and a government. A country's vitality largely hinges on the strength of its civil society.</p><p>For me, the concept of 'civil society' is a broad one. It includes associations devoted to sport, recreation, nature and the environment. But also political groups, trade unions, equal opportunity movements and religious groups. And organisations in the field of education, health care, welfare and social housing. Civil society is a diverse mix of partnerships between people who want to act on their responsibility to society. We should encourage this in every way we can. Being a good citizen is about more than citizenship alone. It is also about getting involved in the work of civil society organisations. In doing this, we are obeying, in a practical way, the Biblical command to 'love your neighbour'.</p><p>Christian social thought is about behaving with due care, showing solidarity with others and looking ahead to the future. It is a value-driven approach. Politicians, administrators and policymakers often lose sight of this aspect. We are so busy amending legislation, devising policy and producing endless reports, that we can forget what policy is actually all about: about people, about values, about right and wrong.</p><p>So I was very pleased when President Lee Myung-bak said last month. 'The Republic of Korea is leading the way toward a new ""era of morality"" '. I think that the global community has a lot to gain from Korea's leadership.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>I now come to the first topical theme that I would like to discuss from the perspective of Christian social values: international solidarity. Globalisation is making the world smaller and richer. The world is enjoying greater prosperity than ever before. But not everyone, by any means, has an equal chance or has a stake in that prosperity. The costs and benefits of globalisation are shared out very unequally. Even today, nearly 2.5 billion people live on less than two dollars a day. The majority of poor people are women. The lack of decent work and income is almost always linked to insufficient access to education, health care, safe drinking water and other basic services.</p><p>Upholding the Christian value of solidarity also means feeling a responsibility for people in need, even those who live far away. That is why the Netherlands is committed to the international agreement that 0.7% of GNP should be spent on development assistance. That is why we support multilateral cooperation through organisations like the IMF, the World Bank and the regional development banks. And that is why we strongly support instruments like microfinance. A practical, concrete and small-scale instrument to support people who are serious about building a better future.</p><p>Investing in development cooperation means investing in difficult circumstances. The Millennium Development Goals are a good example. It is proving an uphill struggle to achieve the goals by 2015. But the prospects for eradicating extreme poverty and hunger by that year are good. And the prospect that all boys and girls will be able to go to school is improving all the time. But in 2015 men and women will still not enjoy equal rights everywhere. Child and maternal mortality will still be too high. And the spread of malaria and HIV/AIDS will still not have been reversed.</p><p>This shows, if we needed reminding, that there are no quick fixes. But also that improvements are always possible. At the moment, there is a strong focus on how aid is delivered, but too little focus on what is achieved with that aid. Responsibility and accountability are two sides of the same coin. Also, we have to make sure that people are not condemned to a lifetime on the sidelines, trapped in poverty and deprived of opportunities. This means that structural improvements and sustainable development will be key. Because the most vulnerable also deserve a fair chance to take responsibility for their lives and to develop their talents. And it is not only up to governments to help them do so. The input of citizens, business and civil society is also important, perhaps even essential.</p><p>Development is not something that can be left entirely to governments. We cannot take a top-down approach. In fact, the criticisms sometimes made of the support we give to the poor have everything to do with neglecting people's own responsibilities and those of their organisations. They have to do with underestimating a society's own power to develop, which comes from its own culture, history and religious beliefs. This is why the Netherlands strongly supports giving civil society a major role of its own, and we support these organisations directly.</p><p>Another way in which we are promoting sustainable development is by pushing for a successful and ambitious conclusion to the Doha Development Agenda. After all, free and fair global trade stimulates economic activity, making a fundamental contribution to poverty reduction. It enables people to escape from the spiral of poverty by their own efforts. This is, I think, the best way of showing solidarity in practice.</p><p>I am happy that the Netherlands and Korea are working side by side to foster international solidarity, and to give the very poorest people a better chance in life. I am most impressed by how, over the last 50 years, your country has transformed itself from aid recipient to aid donor. Thanks to carefully targeted aid, successful educational and industrial policies and, not least, very hard work, Korea has become a world player. Your economy ranks thirteenth in the world, and you are the ninth biggest exporter. Korea is a shining example for developing countries that want to make a similar social and economic leap forward.</p><p>Nor does the Republic of Korea avoid its responsibilities on the international stage. Its contribution to UN peace missions is growing all the time. Korean military personnel are currently serving in Sudan, Lebanon, Liberia, the Western Sahara, Georgia and Kashmir. And from the end of June, 350 troops will be giving protection to the 140-strong Korean aid and reconstruction team in Afghanistan.</p><p>Korea's growing international status is also evident from other geopolitical issues. For example, its hosting of the next Nuclear Security Summit in 2012. But I also have in mind something I recently read in the Financial Times which I very much agree with. I quote: 'In a year when it holds the presidency of the Group of 20 leading economies, South Korea is putting history behind it. It is not only one of the countries rising fastest out of the downturn but could also find itself as a diplomatic leader trying to resolve one of the year's most intractable disputes: Beijing's clash with Washington over the value of the Chinese currency.'</p><p>This brings me neatly to the second societal theme that I want to examine in the light of Christian social thinking: tackling the global financial and economic crisis.</p><p>The decisive, coordinated measures taken by the G-20 to stabilise the financial sector have been successful and have averted even bigger problems. Also, the necessary measures have been taken to get our economies moving again. That is crucial. 'Economic openness has brought the world enormous gains in prosperity in the past and will be a prerequisite for economic growth in the future,' as your President Lee Myung-bak and I noted in a joint article last year.</p><p>But it is now time to draw the lessons from this global crisis. How can we stop something like this happening again? I feel that we can emerge stronger from the crisis. If we view this moment as a turning point in our history, this crisis may prove to be a catalyst for change, for improvement and for progress. </p><p>But first we need a turnaround in the culture that prevailed leading up to the crisis. Reckless behaviour, motivated by pure self-interest, a fixation on profit, unhealthy incentives and the pursuit of short-term success were its dominant features. And this culture affected not only bankers. It also guided the behaviour of entrepreneurs, civil society and politicians. In that sense, the current crisis is above all a moral crisis. A crisis caused by short-sighted and irresponsible behaviour. Maybe it was even a cultural crisis. Perhaps Western culture can learn something from the Eastern way of life, and its greater emphasis on the long term.</p><p>In any case, we must seize this moment and together build a socioeconomic order that is fairer, more balanced and more sustainable. Markets that are guided by values such as trust, solidarity and morality. This is not as fanciful as you might think. Consider the words of the economist Adam Smith, the famous author of 'The Wealth of Nations'. He was also the author of 'The Theory of Moral Sentiments', in which he wrote that markets cannot operate without morality.</p><p>It was with this in mind that last year I made a joint appeal with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. An appeal for a sustainable global economy, based on a strong global framework of shared values that curbs excesses and irresponsible activities. The credit crisis stemmed from a mismatch between international economic integration and a weak international moral framework. We have to restore the trinity of morality, the market and government at international level.</p><p>These clear moral points of reference may help to end the bonus culture. To counteract protectionist tendencies. To take another look at aspects like continuity, loyalty and sustainability in the running of a business.</p><p>Corporate social responsibility - you will all have heard this expression. But according to Enno Masurel, Professor in Sustainable Entrepreneurship at the Free University, Amsterdam, corporate social responsibility means more than 'doing something' in some social or environmental field. That is too non-committal. A company must strive to create societal value. Societal value is the sum of economic, social and ecological values. The Professor introduced a unit of societal value in order to calculate the societal value created by a company.</p><p>This is an interesting idea, because it can reveal the true societal value of a company. And that is essential in a market that respects morality.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>The third and final societal theme I want to discuss is related to the Christian social concept of stewardship. We only have temporary use of this planet. In a way, we are just looking after it for our children and grandchildren. It is our duty, our responsibility, to look after it well. Whether we are succeeding is a question for another day. But it is a fact that our climate is changing. In some parts of the world our rivers are flooding, while in others they are running dry. It is a fact that our water supply is at risk, our ancient forests are being cut down and our supply of fossil fuels is starting to run out.</p><p>Again, we need to change course. We need to preserve and maintain our living environment on this planet. This is something everyone knows. And this is something everyone wants. And yet we seem to find it so difficult to make international binding agreements on climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Take the UN climate conference in Copenhagen last December. The outcome was modest. The lesson from Copenhagen, I think, is that we need to be realistic. The fact is that the major countries have different outlooks on what we need to do next, and how.</p><p>But fortunately some deals have been signed. Like the agreement reached by the G-8 and the European Union to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. The EU has committed itself to a 20% reduction by 2020, rising to 30% if other countries do likewise. Korea, I'm happy to say, is one of the countries with big ambitions on climate policy. This is another area in which Korea is a role model for other newly industrialised economies.</p><p>So the targets are ambitious, and that's good. Although 2050 seems a long way off, it's closer than we think. Because we need to radically change the way we generate electricity to meet the targets. If we are to believe the director of the European Climate Foundation, a think-tank on climate change, we need a revolution. He said, 'we've had the steam engine and the internet. Now we will see an energy transition, to a world in which electricity generation produces almost no greenhouse gases. We have the technology to do this, and it's economically feasible.'</p><p>That last point is an important one, I think. It shows that creating a greener economy can go hand-in-hand with creating jobs. The development of new, clean technologies is serious business. Countries and businesses that don't want to miss the boat, with 2050 in mind, are already investing today in knowledge and innovation. Korea has understood this, as we can see from its 'Green Growth' programme.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>I have talked to you about the core values of Christian social thought. Values we can trace back to the Bible. Values that bind people, organisations and countries. Values that can guide us when we tackle pressing questions facing society.</p><p>The Republic of Korea and the Netherlands share the most important core values. Our bilateral relations have come an extremely long way over the past 350 years. There is a world of difference between the age of Hendrick Hamel and that of Guus Hiddink. Now, in the 21st century, we work together a great deal. Political, economic and cultural cooperation. Cooperation in the area of sport and in the areas of education, research and innovation. Wouldn't it be good if, in all our contacts, we allowed ourselves to be guided by the values that we share? The values that bind us.</p><p>I direct my final words to the students who are here today. The symbol of your university is an eagle spreading its wings. This reflects a certain level of expectation. The expectation that when you leave here, you will take off and fly high. That you will make a difference and set yourself ambitious goals. That you will seize the opportunities that come your way.</p><p>And maybe you will be inspired by the words of the poem 'Seo-si' by Yoon Dong-joo:</p><p>'And I must walk the path </p><p> That's been given to me.'</p><p>Thank you.</p>",19
6,"<p>Ambassador Stanczyk, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Saturday's disaster in Smolensk was a blow to the very heart of Poland. While travelling to an event marking one of the darkest pages in their country's eventful history, President Lech Kaczyński, the first lady and many other prominent Poles lost their lives in a terrible air crash. We can hardly conceive of what this tragedy means for Poland and the Polish people.</p><p>On behalf of the Dutch government, allow me to tell you how deeply we feel for you. The Netherlands grieves with the Polish people and we join in the sorrow of our own Polish community here. Above all, of course, our thoughts are with the relatives of the victims. Although I know that words cannot ease their loss, I would like to tell these families: your sorrow is our sorrow. Your pain is our pain. Your shock is our shock.</p><p>I knew President Kaczyński personally. I will always remember him as a distinctive, passionate statesman. In the last few days I have often recalled the warm reception he gave me at the presidential palace during my two-day visit to Poland in the spring of 2008. The President spoke intensely, as he always did, about Poland's place in Europe and in the world. His main motivation was his great love of Poland and his unyielding commitment to freedom. In the 1980s, as an activist in the Solidarity movement, he fought successfully to make his country truly free and independent. His battle to establish and gain recognition of the truth about what happened in Katyn won our lasting admiration. It is a cruel twist of fate that he died while on the way to an event marking that tragedy.</p><p>I also remember Poland's first lady, Mrs Maria Kaczyńska. She will live on in our memories as a tolerant, honest person with an independent spirit. She was a source of support not only for her husband, but for the entire Polish nation. Her role in helping her country regain its freedom made her loved and respected, both in Poland and abroad.</p><p>Last Saturday, in one tragic moment, Poland lost 96 of its citizens: people who had served their country with devotion, and relatives of those killed in Katyn. Among the dead were the last President of the Polish government-in-exile, the army high command, the president of the National Bank, the national ombudsman and several Members of Parliament. We honour all their memories. One of them was Stanisław Komorowski, who was Ambassador to the Netherlands from 1994 to 1998. His special contribution to Polish-Dutch relations will never be forgotten.</p><p>Earlier this week I read some words of Lech Wałęsa that made a great impression on me: 'It will take a long time until the wounds of our democracy are healed', he said. I think that his words perfectly express the pain that many Poles are feeling now.</p><p>Yet Poland has good reason for hope and confidence. Its hope was symbolised by the sincere, moving embrace between Prime Minister Tusk and Prime Minister Putin at the site of the disaster. That image will always stay with me. And Poland, which has a solid place at the heart of Europe, can be confident of the resilience of the Polish people and the support of its friends - including the Netherlands. We are here for you, as our Polish liberators were there for us in the last months of the Second World War.</p><p>I wish you, your fellow Poles and above all the relatives of the victims the strength you will need in coming to terms with your great loss. The Netherlands mourns with you. Polacy jesteśmy z Wami. [Poland, we are at your side.]</p>",0
7,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Last night, the whole world was treated to the marvellous Opening Ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics. Vancouver has done itself proud. The next two weeks are all about Olympic dreams. About sporting battle. And about fellowship.</p><p>Fellowship among athletes. Among supporters. And among nations. We don't need the glow of the Olympic torch, however, to warm up the relationship between Canada and the Netherlands. The bond between our countries has been close for many years now.</p><p>This is partly thanks to the two-hundred-thousand Dutch migrants who couldn't resist the appeal of the wide, rugged Canadian landscape and chose to settle here for good. Our cultures have become interwoven. And so have our genes. Almost everyone in the Netherlands has an aunt, an uncle or a cousin somewhere in Canada.</p><p>Also crucial was the fact that the Dutch royal family found safe haven in Ottawa during the Second World War. In fact, our queen's younger sister, Princess Margriet, was born there.</p><p>But the deep ties between the Netherlands and Canada are mainly due to the thousands and thousands of young Canadian servicemen who crossed the Atlantic in 1944 and 1945 to fight for freedom. For the freedom of a continent under Nazi rule. For the freedom of millions of people. The Dutch were longing for peace after five long years of living and suffering under the yoke of Nazi occupation. </p><p>The Canadians reached out to the Dutch people in the darkest days of my nation's history. Together with the other Allies, they fought a long, hard campaign - partly in and around the province of Zeeland, where I was born.</p><p>Mark Zuehlke wrote about this in his book, Terrible Victory. The title alone tells the story. It is a tale that takes hold of the reader and doesn't let go. We are caught up in the brutal Battle of the Scheldt. A dangerous, bitter fight to the death, man on man, in soggy mud. We see the hardships the Canadians had to endure. And the sacrifices they made, for many went to their deaths. But we also see their courage and resilience in the face of what Zuehlke calls 'a drenched battlefield that they came to think of as hell.'</p><p>It is 65 years now since the Canadians were victorious and the Netherlands liberated. Sixty-five years is a long time, but our appreciation for those Canadians' heroic deeds has not faded. Nor will it fade. Our gratitude for their role in our history is too great. We will always have the deepest respect for their determination and their spirit of sacrifice.</p><p>It is an honour for me, as Prime Minister of the Netherlands, to stand face to face with several Canadian veterans who fought for my country's freedom 65 years ago. There are no words to express our gratitude. But, honoured veterans, I would like to say the following to you on behalf of the Dutch people.</p><p>You hold a special place in our hearts.</p><p>You are our liberators.</p><p>You are our heroes.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>What makes this gathering today so special is the fact that we have a new generation sitting alongside Canada's veterans. It is vital that we pass the torch of history to the generations that follow. That we keep telling the story of war, and especially the story of peace. So that everyone understands how precious it is. And how fragile. Freedom cannot be taken for granted.</p><p>Sadly, today in 2010, there are still millions of people who face injustice, terror and oppression every day. History has taught us that sometimes, a country can only find the way to peace and security with outside help. Take Afghanistan. I am proud that Canadian and Dutch soldiers are working side by side under the NATO banner to build a better future for the Afghan people. I'm proud that we are working as partners for stability and democracy.</p><p>History has also taught us that freedom is a universal value. And that peace is worth fighting for. Despite the difficulties. Despite the risks. And despite the sacrifices.</p><p>My final words today are for you, the pupils of Delta Secondary School. This spring, together with more than two thousand other young Canadians, you will be travelling to Europe and the Netherlands. You will be present as we in the Netherlands remember the war dead on the fourth of May, and as we celebrate our freedom on the fifth. Sixty-five years of freedom. Thanks in large part to your countrymen. Our Canadian liberators.</p><p>In the Netherlands you will follow in their footsteps. The footsteps of our hard-won peace. You will marvel at their amazing deeds, and you will honour and remember their fallen comrades. You will see the undying gratitude my people feel for the courage and support of your countrymen during the Second World War. </p><p>I wish you a fascinating and instructive journey. And I sincerely hope that you will make new friends in the Netherlands. So that after your visit the bond between Canada and the Netherlands will be closer than ever.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
8,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Today we are looking back at the ten years since the Millennium Development Goals were agreed. But we are also looking forward. We still have five years to go. Five years to make a difference for all those people for whom poverty, hunger and shortages are still everyday realities.</p><p>Looking back, we have good reason to be satisfied with what we have achieved in some areas in the past ten years. Poverty, child mortality and malaria have all been reduced. More girls are attending school. And more people have access to clean drinking water – a subject to which the Netherlands, and in particular our crown prince, are deeply committed.</p><p>At the same time, there is cause for concern. Because our aims are ambitious, but we are moving too slowly. That applies in particular to the MDGs on reducing maternal mortality and achieving equality between men and women. Progress is lagging far behind, and we cannot allow that to happen. So we will have to do better. And we can do better, if we are prepared to think and work outside the box.</p><p>Too often, the Millennium Development Goals are still seen as the sole responsibility of NGOs, governments and multilateral organisations. This is unwise, because the commitment of the private sector is crucial to achieving them. Its knowledge and expertise in fields such as science, logistics and innovation enable us to push forward boundaries in development. Above all, however, the private sector is both a source of and a stimulus to employment, sustainable development and economic growth.</p><p>Research shows that economic growth accounts for 80 per cent of poverty reduction in the world. When per capita income increases, the poorest 20 per cent of the population also benefit. And the higher the growth is and the longer it lasts, the faster poverty rates drop. The same free market principles also operate at grassroots level. We will speak about that later today, when I host a side-event on inclusive finance in the presence of Her Royal Highness Princess Máxima, the Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development.</p><p>So we know that within certain parameters, the mechanisms of the free market are essential for development. But we also know that investing in developing countries is still regarded by many as a risky business. So to get economic growth in gear, the private sector needs a helping hand.</p><p>That is why the Dutch government is strongly in favour of public-private partnerships. We recently drafted a bilateral donors’ statement in support of private sector partnerships for development. Rather than viewing the private sector merely as a cash dispenser, this statement recognises that it is an equal partner in development. We are in this together with the governments of Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US. The International Finance Corporation and UNDP are also involved.</p><p>The governments of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba strongly support this policy of working with the private sector to achieve the MDGs. The upcoming Netherlands Antilles MDG Report will not only emphasise this but also strengthen existing partnerships.</p><p>In a recent letter to co-facilitators, written jointly with the CEOs of several Dutch multinationals, the Dutch government emphasised the importance of innovative partnerships. I quote: ‘The Netherlands believes that greater collaboration between government and business could be instrumental, as it would combine the knowledge and experience of the public sector with the creative solutions and technical expertise of the private sector.’ I am proud that so many Dutch companies are here at this week’s summit to prove that our approach really works.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>To achieve the MDGs, innovative thinking is needed in every field. This applies in particular to MDG3 and MDG5. Every year, over 350,000 women are still dying during pregnancy or childbirth, and in many cases women are still being denied equal rights. Shortly before my departure for New York, I was presented with a petition signed by thousands of Dutch mothers who find it unacceptable that during this summit more than 4,400 women will die during pregnancy or childbirth.</p><p>Like these mothers, the Dutch government believes – and I believe – that equal rights and opportunities for women bring the achievement of most other MDGs closer. Burkina Faso is a good example. By addressing harmful practices and discrimination against women, by expanding and improving family planning services, by committing itself to removing obstacles to health care, this country was able to reduce the number of needless deaths substantially.</p><p>Human rights play a crucial role on the road to 2015. By ensuring equality and non-discrimination, we give the poorest and most vulnerable groups access to basic services. Accountability, the right to participation and freedom of information will enable our efforts to meet the real needs of the population. And making things accessible and affordable ensures that the MDGs are more than a short-term success.</p><p>The key, ladies and gentlemen, is that we combine our strengths and efforts. As members of the UN, as donors and developing countries, and especially as governments and businesses.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
9,"<p>De toespraak is in het Engels gehouden.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Your Majesty,</p><p> Your Royal Highnesses,</p><p> Your Excellencies,</p><p> Laureates,</p><p> President Costa, </p><p> Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Franklin Roosevelt once said that for democracy to flourish, ‘we must … guard the civil rights and civil liberties of all our citizens…. We must remember that any oppression, any injustice, any hatred, is a wedge designed to attack our civilisation.’ He spoke these words at the beginning of 1940.</p><p>Today, on 29 May 2010, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Four Freedoms Award goes to an institution whose work is a clear and constant tribute to the spirit of those words. An institution whose sole aim is to protect the fundamental human rights of the more than 800 million people who live in the continent of Europe.</p><p>I am proud and honoured to present this year’s International Four Freedoms Award to:</p><p>the European Court of Human Rights.</p><p>Sixty years ago, in the wake of the most devastating war in human history, the nations of Europe came together in Rome to draft the European Convention on Human Rights. They were inspired by Franklin Roosevelt’s vision. In the dark days of 1941, he had called for a post-war world founded on four fundamental human freedoms:  freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. They also built on the pioneering work of Eleanor Roosevelt and René Cassin in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Above all, they understood that the European Convention on Human Rights would need a mechanism to enforce it and uphold its principles. And so, nine years later, the European Court of Human Rights was established.</p><p>Since that historic day, a little over 50 years ago, this unique body has played a central role in strengthening democracy and the rule of law. The Court guarantees all Europeans the right to life, to a fair hearing, to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, to the protection of their privacy and property, and to the free expression of ideas. Its binding judgments have led governments across Europe to change their laws and amend their constitutions. In this way the Court has set an example of international cooperation that is an inspiration to the world.</p><p>Over the last 50 years, the European Court of Human Rights has ruled on thousands of cases. It has ensured access to justice for every person in our vast and ancient continent. It has brought security and stability to our society. It has fully earned the respect and support of the member states of the Council of Europe. And even more important, the people of Europe have found the Court to be a fair and powerful instrument of justice on their behalf. Today, we gather to celebrate this great achievement. Because, as Thomas Hammarberg, the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights, said at the Court’s 50th anniversary celebration: ‘The story of the European Court of Human Rights is undoubtedly a success story.’</p><p>President Costa, you recently said that human rights require a permanent battle, because they can never be taken for granted. ‘It is my belief,’ you said, ‘that the European human rights protection system, as it was first set up and has been enhanced by 50 years of case law, has all the necessary characteristics to guarantee it a promising future.’ We all share that belief. Therefore I am presenting this award to you, not only to express our deep appreciation for the Court’s service to democracy and freedom in the past, but also on behalf of future generations.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0

They and their families are in our thoughts today. As I expressed yesterday to President Lee, the Netherlands shares the sorrow and pain of the Korean people. This dreadful tragedy reminds us that serving the cause of peace and freedom often goes hand in hand with great danger and serious risk.</p><p> </p><p>Being here at this cemetery today reminds us of that as well. Willi de Vries, a Dutch veteran of the Korean War, once said, 'Surely I will go to heaven when I die, for I have been in hell already.' He survived his deployment to Korea; 121 Dutch soldiers did not, and four have been missing ever since.</p><p> </p><p>The stories of the men laid to rest in this cemetery testify to bad luck and incredible bravery. They are stories of soldiers fighting for freedom, whatever the circumstances. We remember Private Ketting Olivier, whose unit stormed the enemy position in the infamous battle of hill 325. He was the first inside, and he paid with his life. We also remember the leadership of Lieutenant-Colonel Den Ouden, who always led his men from the front and who died at Hoengseong. Their names are among the many who paid the ultimate price. We honour them, and we honour the ROKS, the Republic of Korea soldiers, who fought alongside them and shared their faith in the cause of freedom. When the free world asked for a sacrifice, these brave men were ready. It is now our obligation to remember and to honour their sacrifice.</p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>This year we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War. There is still no official peace, and the Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea is a scar that separates families from their loved ones, rich from poor, and democracy from dictatorship. I was there this morning and I want to say that I could feel the dark shadows of the past all around me.</p><p> </p><p>This experience again underlines the importance of memorial services like today's. They focus our minds on the suffering caused by war and aggression, past and present. And they serve as a platform for involving young people in remembrance and keeping history alive.</p><p> </p><p>So today we turn to the past and honour the victims from all the nations represented here. But we also voice our support for and gratitude to the men and women who have risked their lives since then to promote peace and security all over the world. We honour those who have defended freedom and justice in the past, and we honour those who do so today. These soldiers, who include Korean and Dutch troops, are not fighting for territory or spoils of war. They are fighting to protect those who need our protection, to help those who need our support and to bring peace where there is conflict.</p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>I would like to thank those who made today's remembrance ceremony possible. Thank you for offering us this peaceful location to remember our war victims and to reflect on the suffering caused by armed conflicts all over the world.</p><p> </p><p>May I ask you to join me in one minute's silence to honour the memory of all the men, women and children who suffered and died in the Korean War and in memory of the 46 crew members of the Navy Ship Cheonan.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
11,"<p>De toespraak is in het Engels gehouden.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>President Seike, Vice-President Haseyama, Dean Ohkami, distinguished guests from Delft University of Technology, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Ohayo gozaimasu.</p><p>I stand before you, filled with gratitude for the great honour that I have received today: an honorary doctorate from this distinguished university. Keio University was established in 1858. In that same year, Japan and the Netherlands started diplomatic relations. Keio's founder, Fukuzawa Yukichi, spoke fluent Dutch and spent over a month in my country in 1862. For me, these connections make this honour even more special.</p><p>Keio is a university with a rich history. A university that has been looking ahead for more than 150 years and training leaders who can shape the future. A university with ambitions for the next 150 years too!</p><p>I have every confidence that students in the Graduate School of Systems Design and Management will be actively involved in that future. Because here, they learn to consider complex social issues from an interdisciplinary perspective. Beyond scientific boundaries. Beyond national borders. Beyond cultural frontiers. In my opinion, this is where innovation starts. Only by being innovative and groundbreaking can we create concrete solutions. Solutions that can guarantee a prosperous, sustainable and social future for us all.</p><p>It's difficult to avoid the conclusion that all over today's world, society is out of balance. We have reached the limits of our present system - economically and morally. It is proving to be a very painful experience. The financial and economic crisis has upset the balance between countries, businesses and people all over the world. What we need now is to take decisive steps towards a new and stable global system in which there is more room for solidarity, stability and sustainability.</p><p>Today I want to talk to you about restoring the balance in our global socioeconomic framework. And I want to focus on the way in which Japan and the Netherlands can work together to make it happen. After all, we have a robust partnership that has stood the test of time. A partnership based on mutual trust and shared values.</p><p>First of all, I will sketch the historical ties between Japan and the Netherlands, and draw a number of parallels between the economic and social trends in our two countries. I will then discuss several areas in which we are working as partners in 2009. And finally, I will consider ways in which Japan and the Netherlands can work together on the future design of a new global framework.</p><p>Let's begin by taking a look at our history. This year, Japan and the Netherlands are celebrating 400 years of trade relations. On 24 August 1609, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted the Netherlands a trade permit. And for the past four centuries, we have kept on trading with Japan. Because even during the </p><p>sakoku</p><p>, the period in which Japan isolated itself from the rest of the world, contact with the Netherlands was maintained for over 200 years. The small, fan-shaped island of Deshima in the Bay of Nagasaki was Japan's window on the West. The Netherlands is extremely proud of this.</p><p>The historical relationship between Japan and the Netherlands is unique, but by no means accidental. In the early modern period, our economic and cultural interaction rested on distinct but parallel developments in our societies. Both Japan and the Netherlands took decisive steps towards becoming economic societies first and foremost. And that is why trade and the exchange of scientific knowledge between our two countries flourished.</p><p>We can see this if we look briefly at each country's economic development. In 1600, the Netherlands was a very young state. It was still breaking free from the country that had dominated it for many years: Spain. The struggle against Spain had started in 1568. But waging war is a very expensive business. Fortunately, the Netherlands was already emerging as a modern economic superpower. And because of this, resistance against Spanish rule continued well into the next century.</p><p>In the course of the seventeenth century, the Netherlands became the world's first economy that might be described as 'modern'. Fiscal policy, urbanisation, a high level of production, a relatively well-educated population and a worldwide trading network were some of the main ingredients of the first cycle of modern economic growth.</p><p>These economic developments in the Netherlands had parallels in Japan. Here, too, history took a decisive turn in the year 1568. With his march on Kyoto, the warlord Oda Nobunaga triggered a unique train of events that led to the Japanese archipelago being pacified and unified under a single military ruler in 1600. And slowly but surely, under this Pax Tokugawa, Japan became an economic society - the first of its kind in Asia.</p><p>In the seventeenth century, Japan was the world's leading exporter of silver. Like the Netherlands, early modern Japan enjoyed a high degree of urbanisation and literacy. There was a steady rise in levels of output, driven by economic specialisation and trade networks.</p><p>We can also see an interesting parallel between Japan and the Netherlands at the end of the nineteenth century. In both countries, the work and thought of a single genius brought about crucial social changes that can still be felt today.</p><p>In Japan, the driver of change was of course Fukuzawa Yukichi, whose philosophy represented a break with traditional thinking. He reformed Japanese society by introducing Western ideas, institutions and customs. He was a firm advocate of personal independence, which in his view would ultimately lead to national independence. To him, the acquisition of knowledge was key. To quote his own words: 'any existing distinction between the wise and the stupid, between the rich and the poor, comes down to a matter of education.'</p><p>The work of Abraham Kuyper was of similar significance to Dutch society. Kuyper was a contemporary of Fukuzawa, and he too was an advocate of personal development. He particularly wanted to strengthen individual responsibility for social ties, whether in the family and the church, or in academic and business life. He was also a great thinker and a prolific author, whose writings are still a source of inspiration today. Like Fukuzawa, Abraham Kuyper founded a daily newspaper and a university - in fact, the same one where I studied and later taught as a professor.</p><p>Education is crucial for a country's development. This is true in both Japan and the Netherlands. So I am delighted that our audience here today includes several professors from Delft University of Technology, one of Keio's partner universities in the Netherlands. After all, sharing knowledge benefits both partners in any relationship.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>'Let us allow our countries to come closer together and let us from now on deepen our friendship even more.' Those words are from a letter written by Tokugawa Ieyasu to the Dutch stadholder Prince Maurits in 1609. And as a result of that deepening friendship, the Japanese language has adopted a number of terms from Dutch. One of them is the Dutch word 'kompas', </p><p>konpasu</p><p> in Japanese, which I find striking. A compass after all, is something that indicates direction and helps you reach your destination. You could say that Japan and the Netherlands have been finding their way together for several centuries. Travelling the same path and helping each other along the way. That is as true today as it was in the past.</p><p>This, in fact, is my second point: in the twenty-first century, our paths are converging more than ever. Socially, culturally, scientifically, and of course economically. For instance, there are about 400 Japanese companies currently operating in the Netherlands. Recently, the Dutch director of Teijin Holdings, which produces synthetic and industrial fibres for bullet-proof vests and aircraft, was interviewed in a Dutch magazine about the advantages of doing business in the Netherlands. He said, 'Without our Dutch branch we would have missed out on key innovation opportunities. Teijin came to the Netherlands not only for the technology but also because it is the gateway to the rest of Europe. Within a single day you can travel to almost any European city and back. In addition, most Dutch people speak good English, there is an attractive investment climate, the tax system is business-friendly and there are daily direct flights between Amsterdam and Tokyo or Osaka.'</p><p>You can imagine that as Prime Minister of the Netherlands, I felt proud when I read these words. The Dutch government is very serious about developing high-quality innovation and technology. That is also why I'm joined on this trip by members of the Dutch Innovation Platform. We want to strengthen our cooperation with Japan in the area of innovation. And to give a clear signal that we are working extra hard to remain an attractive location for foreign companies who want to do business in the Netherlands.</p><p>At the moment, the Dutch government is also devoting attention to another, very different issue - our ageing population. We are relying on a shrinking workforce to maintain our high level of facilities. Your country is facing the same problem. Of all the OECD member countries, the phenomenon of demographic ageing is most acute in Japan. By 2020, 28% of the Japanese population will be over 65. In the Netherlands, the percentage for that year will be almost 20%. The negative consequences for the economy and government finances will be enormous. In order to guarantee a high quality of life, technological progress is essential. Japan is a clear leader in this field, so we in the Netherlands hope to draw lessons from your experience.</p><p>And the same is true the other way round. Japan may be able to learn from the way we in the Netherlands are trying to increase labour participation. To maintain our welfare state, we need to have more people in work. It's as simple as that. For several years, we have been encouraging elderly people and women to work more and to work longer. And we have been successful! In 2003, 37.5% of the total number of people aged over 55 were working. In 2008, that figure rose to nearly 45%. In the past five years, the proportion of working women has gone up by almost 6% and now stands at 59%.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>We all know that our long shared history also contains a dark and tragic page. Yesterday, I laid a wreath at Hodogaya Cemetery, to commemorate the victims of the Second World War. And during my meeting with your Prime Minister, Mr Hatoyama, we talked about the war and about those who lost their lives. It was a valuable conversation.</p><p>We also focused on the fact that nowadays, both our countries cherish universal values such as human rights, democracy and solidarity. Respect for the international rule of law is extremely important to us both.</p><p>Japan is living its values by contributing no less than 20% of the budget of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. And since the Netherlands is home to many international law institutions, we greatly appreciate Japan's generosity.</p><p>The International Criminal Court is not the only institution which can count on Japan. Your country also gives generously to the United Nations budget for peace operations, provides funding and manpower for civil reconstruction operations in post-conflict areas, and is one of the biggest donors in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2004, Japanese and Dutch troops also worked side by side on a successful mission in Iraq.</p><p>Japan is turning its international ambitions for peace, security and justice into action. Your country deserves respect for its efforts. I hope that in the future, Japan will continue its endeavours and increasingly take on the international responsibilities that correspond to its stature as a nation.</p><p>And now I come to my third and final point: turning global ambition into global action is also a vital part of restoring the balance to our system.</p><p>We need to recalibrate that system. The financial and economic crisis has caused devastation all over the world. The limits have been reached - and then breached. To prevent it happening again, we must learn our lesson. I am convinced that we can come out of this crisis stronger than we were before. But we must dare to change.</p><p>In this connection, I would like to quote Keio University's president, Professor Atsushi Seike. Professor, you said, 'In such periods of major transition, pre-conceived ideas and old-fashioned thinking have little relevance.'</p><p>It is indeed time to find a new balance: one that does justice to the new reality. We must design a new global framework in which shared values and interests are placed above narrow self-interest. A framework which takes into account the interests of all - especially the world's weakest and poorest people.</p><p>We can only achieve this by working together. The problems are simply too big to be solved by one single country or by some chance coalition of like-minded nations. I was pleased to see that everyone present at the recent G20 summit in Pittsburgh seemed well aware of this fact. For the Netherlands, it is absolutely crucial. After all, we have the world's sixteenth largest economy and the ninth largest financial sector. We are also the fifth largest trading nation on Earth.</p><p>Japan has made it clear that it will not walk away from this responsibility. I was particularly pleased to know that. Because Japan is the second largest economic power in the world. A major global player, not least because of its active role in other international fora. A global player that can make a difference in these uncertain times.</p><p>So I look forward to deepening the cooperation between Japan and the Netherlands, bilaterally and at G20 level. Because this is the playing field where the rules of the game will be agreed for the future. Our countries may be natural partners in designing a future framework: partly because of our shared history, we have a number of important values and interests in common.</p><p>As countries that have been trading together for 400 years, Japan and the Netherlands have a unique understanding of the importance of free world trade. It is the strongest driver of economic growth and employment. Unfortunately, a number of countries are currently trying to introduce protectionist measures to safeguard or benefit their own domestic markets. That is not the way forward. Ultimately, it boils down to pouring sand into the world's economic gas tank. We all benefit from an economic engine that runs smoothly.</p><p>So we must strongly oppose protectionism and vigorously defend free world trade. The Doha Round must be successfully completed in 2010. In all these issues, I sincerely hope that Japan - together with the Netherlands - is prepared to demonstrate its support.</p><p>The same applies to our efforts to make a success of the climate summit in Copenhagen in December. Both our countries aim to achieve a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions and set great store by a post-Kyoto treaty. What is the best way to deal with climate change? Unfortunately, there are no simple solutions. But the technology is there, and so is the money. The only question is: do industrialised nations, emerging economies and developing countries have the courage and the political will to act? I hope that the answer we hear in December is 'yes'.</p><p>I was impressed by the plans presented by Prime Minister Hatoyama so soon after taking office. Plans for Japanese emissions reductions and for the new government's involvement in the climate summit. Mr Hatoyama and I agreed yesterday that in Copenhagen we will do everything we can to win over those countries that are still undecided.</p><p>This is the time to make choices. And in my opinion, the time to champion core values for sustainable business. In Pittsburgh, we agreed to work out a set of values that will guide the development of the framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. The Netherlands is glad that more and more countries are realising that markets and morality need to go hand in hand. That economic prosperity must be matched by a concern for the weaker nations. That technological progress need not exhaust all our national resources. That solidarity with the poorest countries and achieving the Millennium Development Goals are a moral imperative.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>It has been a great pleasure to be here today at Keio University. Once again, let me express my profound gratitude for this honorary doctorate. It has been an honour to talk to you about the special relationship between Japan and the Netherlands: two countries that are very different, certainly. But fortunately, two countries that also have a great deal in common. This has enabled us to enjoy 400 years of close partnership.</p><p>I believe that in the future, our continued cooperation will bring great benefit to both countries. But our special partnership can also be valuable in a global sense. I have just been talking about the imbalances in our present system. I am convinced that the balance can be restored, and that Japan and the Netherlands can help to make a difference. Following the same 'konpasu' seems to me an excellent basis for the future. Working on the challenges in both our countries, but also tackling global challenges together. And as we continue on our journey, may these words of Fukuzawa Yukichi be a source of inspiration:</p><p>'</p><p>In its broad sense, civilisation means not only comfort in daily necessities but also the refining of knowledge and the cultivation of virtue so as to elevate human life to a higher plane.'</p><p>Thank you.</p>",22
12,"<p>De toespraak is in het Engels gehouden.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>This year we commemorate the 400th anniversary of formal trade relations between Japan and the Netherlands. Ever since then our shared history has been characterised by friendship, trade and the exchange of cultural experience and scientific knowledge. The Second World War is a notable and sad exception to this rewarding relationship. We are gathered here today because in 2009 we commemorate our common history in its entirety, including the suffering of the dark years of war.</p><p>Here, in the peace and serenity of the British Commonwealth War Cemetery, the remains of 21 Dutch prisoners of war are interred. Their bodies were washed ashore after the ship transporting them to Japan was torpedoed.</p><p>All in all, some 870 Dutchmen died in Japan during the war years, 71 of them as a consequence of forced labour in the coal mines of Mizumaki on Kyushu. Around 20,000 Dutch military were taken as prisoners of war and detained throughout Asia. And many, many more - men, women and children - were held in civilian internment camps after the Japanese armed forces overran the then Dutch East Indies in 1942. The hunger, disease, violence, forced prostitution, forced labour and brutal treatment they suffered, fill all who learn about these atrocities with horror and pain. Today I ask you to join me in honouring their memories and the memories of all those who suffered in Asia during those terrible years.</p><p>Sixty-four years have passed since the end of the Second World War. Japan and the Netherlands have long since been reconciled and we have rebuilt our longstanding friendship. But reconciliation has not always been easy, also due to differences in interpretation of what happened and why.</p><p>The importance of memorial services such as today's has not diminished in any way. Held in hallowed places, these gatherings enable nations as well as individuals to squarely face the past and honour their victims. They focus our minds on the suffering caused by war and aggression in past en present. And they serve as a platform to involve the young and keep history alive. It is a genuine pleasure to see so many young faces from Setogaya Elementary School. Welcome to you all.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Since 1945 both Japan and the Netherlands have been spared the suffering of large-scale war. Our governments are committed to peacefully resolving international security issues on the international agenda. So today's service not only commemorates the war dead of our grandparents' and parents' generation. It also reminds us of the crucial importance of peace and respect for human dignity in our own time.</p><p>Today we honour those who perished more than sixty years ago. In doing so, we are also voicing our dedication and gratitude to the men and women who have risked their lives since then to promote peace and security all over the world. These soldiers, including Dutch and Japanese, do not fight to seize territory or other spoils of war. They fight to protect those who need our protection, to help those who need our help and to bring peace where there is conflict.</p><p>I would like to thank those who made this remembrance ceremony possible. Thank you for offering us this peaceful location to remember our war victims and to reflect upon the suffering caused by armed conflicts that are ongoing in other parts of the world.</p><p>May I ask you to join me in one minute's silence to honour the memory of all the men, women and children who lost their lives and who suffered in Asia during the Second World War. Thank you.</p>",0
13,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>President Theodore Roosevelt once said: 'The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first, the love of soft living, and the get-rich-quick theory of life.'</p><p>These are wise words. Because they are still relevant today. But above all, because they apply not only to the United States but to the whole world. For wasn't the present economic crisis caused by the pursuit of </p><p>prosperity at any price</p><p>? Hasn't a few people's </p><p>love of soft living</p><p> impacted the lives of millions? Are we not all in danger due to the </p><p>get-rich-quick</p><p> theory of life?</p><p>Our most critical task at present is of course to tackle the global crisis. To prevent our financial system from collapsing and to promote economic activity with smart and effective measures. But we also need to consider what lessons we can and must learn. How can we prevent this from ever happening again? We will be discussing this issue at the UN General Assembly and the G20 summit in Pittsburgh this week. It is also a recurring theme at this Global Creative Leadership Summit. To kick off today's discussion, I would like to share a few thoughts with you.</p><p>I believe this crisis will prove to be a catalyst for change, improvement and progress. We can emerge from the crisis stronger than we were before. But only if we can bring about a change of culture. For so long now, the profit motive and self-interest have driven our lives. Not only the lives of bankers. But also the lives of company executives. Of directors in non-profit organisations. And of politicians. And what has it brought us?</p><p>I think we should see this crisis as an opportunity to work together to make the economic and social order fairer, more balanced and more sustainable. To create a market system guided by values such as trust, solidarity and morality. No one lives in total isolation. All our actions are embedded in a social context. A context that we have neglected, unfortunately.</p><p>It is time we put an end to this. In the international political arena. In our own countries. And in business. Let us take a quick look at each of these three areas.</p><p>International political arena</p><p>First, the international political arena. I was very impressed by President Obama's speech to Wall Street last week. He clearly stated that the old habits that led us into the crisis are no longer acceptable.</p><p>That is one of the reasons I am so confident that at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh we can take an important step towards the culture change that the financial sector so badly needs. Business as usual is not an option. It is time to put an end to ingrained imbalances and excesses.</p><p>Stricter supervision, clear regulation, more transparency, better risk management and greater integrity and morality - that is the path we must follow. I think we can take the first key steps along this path in Pittsburgh.</p><p>To reform the existing system and bring about a change of culture, the global community must work together and agree on key principles. For example, by agreeing to curb reckless behaviour and perverse incentives. I find the existing bonus culture in the financial sector a real problem - and fortunately I am not alone. Let us recognise that pursuing short-term profit, focusing exclusively on our own interests and taking excessive risks have caused real misery. We can and must do things differently.</p><p>National level</p><p>In the Netherlands the banking sector has taken a major first step towards restoring trust. The Dutch Bankers' Association recently drew up a code that commits banks to the principles of prudent and sustainable banking. It contains agreements on limiting variable remuneration, introduces an ethical oath for bankers, and lays down standards for expertise and life-long education. This is unique in the world. By adopting the code Dutch bankers are showing that they are concerned not only with themselves but also with the moral and social context.</p><p>It is not only bankers who sometimes lose sight of the bigger picture. National governments are sometimes guilty of this too. One example is the introduction of protectionist measures. I am convinced that protectionism will frustrate long-term economic recovery. It obstructs free trade. It attests to the pursuit of pure self-interest. And it puts businesses in developing countries at an unnecessary disadvantage. In the social market system that I advocate, this issue warrants special attention. A fairer distribution of economic opportunities and prosperity is ultimately in the interests of us all.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Business</p><p>This brings me to my third and final point. The current economic situation offers an opportunity to change corporate culture. And to strengthen corporate ethics.</p><p>The crisis is reinforcing a trend in which consumers look at more than simply the price of a product. They also want producers to focus on people, the environment and society. They want producers to satisfy stakeholders as well as shareholders. They are interested in sustainability. In the long-term future.</p><p>Family businesses show that a long-term strategy is ultimately more profitable. In the Netherlands, family businesses are the silent engine of the economy. They account for half of Dutch GDP and 40% of jobs. Investments in these businesses are given time to yield a return. Investors are patient, which encourages calm and stability. Compare that with the situation in listed companies, which are ruled by short-termism. If quarterly figures are disappointing, this immediately causes concern. We must escape from the straitjacket of short-term thinking. We need to understand that in the long run patient capital always triumphs over speculative capital.</p><p>The achievements of the Dutch chemical group DSM clearly show that a long-term vision brings rewards. This year, DSM proudly rose to the top of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the chemical industry. Because it sees innovation and sustainable development as its core values. Because it does not allow disappointing turnover to jeopardise its contribution to the UN's World Food Programme. And because it has an intensive programme for developing leaders who not only talk about giving equal attention to people, planet and profitability, but genuinely do so.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>DSM rejects prosperity at any price. And so should we. It's time for change. But also time for action. Action that puts an end to the get-rich-quick theory of life.</p><p>Now that I have outlined my own views, I would really like to hear what you think. So let me conclude with three questions:</p><p>Thank you.</p>",7
14,"<p>Your Excellencies, Mr Sosabowski, honoured veterans, Madam Mayor, Mr Baltussen, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>Sixty-five years ago they suddenly dropped from the sky over Driel: the men of the First Independent Polish Parachute Brigade, commanded by Stanisław Sosabowski.</p><p> </p><p>Far from home, they drifted through the air, both saviours and targets. They were keyed up for the fierce battle that lay ahead. And they fought that battle with total devotion. Unyielding. Brave. Resolute.</p><p> </p><p>These soldiers served loyally in Operation Market Garden. And today on Poland Square, we pay tribute to their struggle. We remember with gratitude the Polish parachutists and their leader, who did not flinch in the face of danger. And we honour the Polish and other Allied soldiers who gave their lives at the Battle of Arnhem.</p><p> </p><p>Sixty-five years ago hundreds of heroes dropped from the sky over Driel. Heroes who had to wait many years for recognition. I am glad to say that in 2006, we did justice to their role in history. In conferring the Military Order of William on the First Independent, we gave the brave deeds of this Polish brigade the recognition they deserved. And by awarding the Bronze Lion to the late Major-General Sosabowski, we gave him the high honour he personally was due.</p><p> </p><p>The Netherlands owes Poland a great debt of gratitude. The Poles showed their solidarity with us in the darkest period of our national history. We can never forget that they gave us the most precious of gifts: freedom.</p><p> </p><p>On 1 September I was on the Polish peninsula of Westerplatte in Gdansk. I joined the Polish people there in commemorating the outbreak of the Second World War, seventy years ago. The Polish people suffered terribly in the years that followed: not only during the war but afterwards as well. It was especially cruel that Poland's military heroes, who had helped free the Netherlands, could not taste the sweetness of freedom when they went home to their own country. The end to repression, fear and terror did not come to Poland until 1989. That is something else we should never forget.</p><p> </p><p>The struggle for freedom in the Netherlands and in Poland were chapters from the same book. The book of war and peace on our diverse continent. The book of Europe.</p><p> </p><p>Europe was divided, literally cut in two, for decades. With the accession of Poland and other former Warsaw Pact countries to the European Union, Europe took a big step towards unity. That is something to celebrate. For there is so much that binds us. Values like democracy, freedom and human rights. And tolerance, justice and solidarity.</p><p> </p><p>These are the values that Major-General Sosabowski and his men fought for sixty-five years ago. Here in Driel today, we pause to remember their struggle. In eternal gratitude.</p>",0
15,"<p>De toespraak is in het Engels gehouden:</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen</p><p>,</p><p>It is my great pleasure to take part in the presentation of the Netherlands Pavilion</p><p> </p><p>for the Shanghai 2010 World Expo. This ceremony is part of my official visit to China and it underscores the excellent bilateral relations between our countries. I am greatly impressed by China's achievements in the fields of sustainable growth, energy and investment. During my meetings with the Chinese government we expressed our mutual willingness to improve our bilateral cooperation even further</p><p>.</p><p>The world is looking forward to the start of the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. I was told that you expect 70 million visitors, which is a very impressive number! The Expo's theme is 'Better city, better life': a very interesting and relevant theme. Countries and regions all over the world face the challenge of urbanisation. How can we maintain and improve the quality of life of a rising number of urban citizens? How can we best manage and make use of scarce resources such as clean water, air and soil? How can we create a comfortable city that uses less energy? I congratulate the Shanghai World Expo Authority on their choice and thank them for offering the participants such an interesting thematic framework for their national pavilions</p><p>.</p><p>The Netherlands is a small, densely populated country with a large economy. The Dutch had to be creative and innovative in order to combine our lack of space with a high quality of life</p><p>.</p><p>I've talked about water, innovative use of space, creative arts and developing better cities. These are all clearly reflected in the Netherlands Pavilion for EXPO 2010. I believe that the design reflects the original Dutch way of dealing with space. Or rather lack of space. The pavilion was designed by Dutch architect and visual artist John Körmeling. Its name is Happy Street</p><p>.</p><p>Streets make up the fabric of every city. Happy Street represents an ideal street, in an ideal neighourhood or city, which people can experience in the Dutch way: on foot. Along the way, you will find a number of small Dutch houses. Each is a mini pavilion that showcases Dutch creativity and innovation in the use of space, energy, technology, art and water. We are confident that Happy Street will give the Chinese public an excellent impression of the Netherlands</p><p>.</p><p>And we will be delighted to welcome you to our pavilion in 2010</p><p>!</p><p>Thank you</p><p>.</p>",1
16,"<p>De toespraak is in het Engels gehouden:</p><p>Mr Gu Binglin, Mr Xie Zhenhua, Mr Van den Berg, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>By 2011 at the latest, Delft University of Technology and Tsinghua University plan to launch two satellites that will measure the impact of pollution on climate change. This will mark a new high point in a partnership that has already lasted for more than 25 years. In that time, the ties between these two leading research institutes have only grown stronger.</p><p> </p><p>This deserves the highest praise, because international cooperation is imperative if we are to solve the global challenges we face. Particularly those at the interface between energy and climate change.</p><p> </p><p>When you, Mr Gu Binglin, visited Delft University of Technology in 2005, you made the following remark in an interview</p><p>.</p><p>'Sustainable technology is extremely important for China. My country is developing very rapidly and development, especially energy consumption, has to be sustainable</p><p>.'</p><p>What appeals to me here is that you use the terms 'sustainable' and 'energy' in the same breath. It is crystal clear that the link is essential - and not only in China. The facts are there for all to see</p><p>:</p><p>As in many other areas, Chinese knowledge and expertise in the field of energy go back much further than ours. More than 2,000 years ago Chinese engineers were drilling deep boreholes to extract natural gas from the earth. They transported it to the surface with bamboo pipelines and used it in refining salt</p><p>.</p><p>Hi-tech has come a long way since then. A few weeks ago, for example, I was allowed to take a short drive in the prototype of a new racing car: the Lotus 270E Tri-Fuel to be precise. I love fast cars, so this was of course a wonderful experience. But even more wonderful was filling up this beautiful car with bio-methanol, a fuel that is extracted from waste material. No oil or gas is needed. And no food crops. So this Lotus is an excellent example of a very promising innovation</p><p>.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, of course the Lotus 270E and early Chinese gas extraction are different in many ways. But they show us that, where energy is concerned, everything revolves around innovation. Around the courage and creativity of pioneering technologists. And around a social environment that encourages the development and application of new, high-grade knowledge</p><p>.</p><p>That is why Dutch policy on innovation is so active and ambitious. Our aim is to achieve a sustainable energy supply by 2050. Sustainable in the sense of clean, reliable and affordable. A good example is the way we view our greenhouse culture sector. By around 2020, growers should no longer be among our greatest energy consumers; they must be producers of energy. Can this be done? Yes of course it can!</p><p> </p><p>In fact, it's already happening. During the summer, one grower in the village of Bergerden stores the surplus heat from his greenhouse as hot water under the ground. In the winter he pumps the water up again. He started this project in 2006, and this year, for the first time, his greenhouse produced more heat than he needed for his own use. This is only one of the many, many initiatives which will enable the Netherlands to achieve a fifty per cent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050. Because that is one of our specific goals</p><p>.</p><p>And this is why cooperation between China and the Netherlands is so very important. We can learn a lot from each other. And we must. Because global problems demand global action and global cooperation. I would like to take this opportunity to say how much the Netherlands admires China's efforts to combat climate change. I salute you, Mr Xie Zhenhua, for the National Energy Administration's commitment to achieving the ambitious Chinese energy saving targets for 2010. China's conscious decision to pursue 'quality growth, rather than mere fast growth' is of great significance for the whole world.</p><p>Your efforts and ours will be even more successful if we work together more closely and more extensively on energy. It is without doubt in our common interest</p><p>.</p><p>Take, for example, Dutch involvement in the 'Asia pro Eco projects' that advise industries on how they can achieve energy savings in their production processes. These savings are then set down in voluntary long-term agreements with the government. In the Netherlands, this model has been working successfully for more than twenty years, because voluntary agreements are accepted more readily than intrusive legislation. They have helped us to dramatically increase energy efficiency, especially in the chemicals, iron and steel sectors</p><p>.</p><p>I could give you more examples of existing partnership projects. They cover a wide range of areas, from wind energy to CO2 storage. But the most exceptional energy project in which we are both involved is without doubt the famous ITER project, with its focus on nuclear fusion as a clean, safe and inexhaustible source of energy. We all know that this is a highly complex subject, not only in terms of the technology required. And we all know that the large-scale application of nuclear fusion is a dream for the very long term. But if we were to succeed, it would be a breakthrough as important as discovering how to make fire</p><p>.</p><p>What makes ITER unique is that the entire world is investing in it. Not only China and the European Union, but also countries like Russia, Japan, the United States, South Korea and India. That sends an important message: that the international community regards the energy issue as a joint responsibility</p><p>.</p><p>I cannot say often enough how important that is, especially given the revision of the Kyoto agreements in Copenhagen next year. Regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020. If the summit produces a strong agreement, then the EU will reduce its target even further, to 30 per cent. But for such an agreement to work, commitment is needed from major industrial nations like the US, and the large emerging economies like China and Brazil. They too will have to make a contribution that is in line with the national conditions and opportunities they face. Given the great effort that China has already made and its pursuit of 'quality growth', I am confident that you will prove to be one of the main contributors to a successful new agreement in Copenhagen</p><p>.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen</p><p>,</p><p>One thing is clear. There are plenty of energy-related areas in which China and the Netherlands can continue to work together, both now and in the future. I have no doubt that Tsinghua University and Delft University of Technology will be at the forefront of developments in the years to come. The two satellites that you will launch are an excellent symbol of this. Let us continue to work together towards 'Energy for the future', believing that the sky is the limit. And with that thought in mind, let me close by wishing you a very inspiring seminar</p><p>.</p><p>Thank you</p><p>.</p>",0
17,"<p>De toespraak is in het Engels gehouden:</p><p>Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>When Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and I meet, we often talk about agriculture. The reason is that we both carry a 'genetic' burden - to use this morning's terminology.</p><p>He is a former agriculture minister and my father was the director of a grain trade. This creates a bond between us.</p><p>Far more important, of course, is the fact that China and the Netherlands are both major agricultural nations. China is the world leader in the production of grain, cotton, rapeseed, peanuts and fruit.</p><p> </p><p>The Netherlands is a major producer and international trader of flowers, fruit and vegetables, seed and many related products. So in both our countries the agricultural sector and the food industry are very important for the economy.</p><p> </p><p>A few facts and figures: the Netherlands is the world's largest exporter of agricultural products after the United States. In 2007 Dutch exports of agricultural products amounted to 59 billion euros. Dutch plant breeders alone generate a turnover of 2.5 billion euros a year. Their annual exports are valued at 1 billion euros and they employ 11 thousand people. This makes the plant breeding sector one of the flagships of our agricultural sector.</p><p>Both China and the Netherlands see science and technology as important ways of improving agricultural production. That is why we are here today. China's achievements in this field are impressive. The hybrid rice developed by Chinese rice breeding experts is one of the world's most productive varieties. That is something to be proud of, because feeding one-fifth of the world's population from an area of arable land that amounts to only seven per cent of the world's cultivated land is a major task.</p><p>My country too is proud of its history in agriculture. Not only in research, development and production but also in marketing, trade and logistics. Did you know, for example, that Dutch traders introduced legume seeds into China back in the 18th century? That is why they are known here as 'Dutch beans'. Since then we have continued to make our mark. Nowadays the Netherlands is a world leader in plant breeding and the production of propagation material.</p><p>Let me give you an example of a recent Dutch programme that ties in with this Year of the Potato. The notorious potato blight still causes many bad harvests throughout the world, and this seriously affects the food situation in poorer countries. In the West and elsewhere we use chemical pesticides to combat this disease, but they are expensive and bad for the environment. Researchers in Wageningen are now searching for resistant genes in wild potato varieties.</p><p> </p><p>They then transfer them to cultivated varieties through genetic modification. If they succeed in giving our potatoes long-term resistance, a major social and environmental problem will be solved. That would be fantastic.</p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>It is only a small step from Chinese rice and the Dutch potato to this important meeting. We are here today because we are convinced that we will benefit from working together in green genetics. We are involved in several projects together, as agriculture minister Gerda Verburg will explain shortly.</p><p> </p><p>The Dutch government strongly believes that there is no such thing as 'splendid isolation' in innovation. So I am pleased to see all the important parties from the green genetics sector in China and the Netherlands gathered here this morning: the two ministries, research institutes and companies involved in agriculture.</p><p>The Netherlands has great respect for the innovative spirit of the Chinese people. We all know that China is set to become a leading research and knowledge provider. Its decision to give priority to innovation is producing impressive results. And the goal of raising annual investments in research and development to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2020 is an example for all of us.</p><p>Knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship are also key elements of the Dutch government's programme and the Dutch business landscape.</p><p> </p><p>Our strength lies in areas such as water, environment and energy, the creative industries, information technology, life sciences and - last but not least - the agricultural sector.</p><p>One of the key areas we have selected for innovation is 'flowers and food'. We try to match supply and demand in these areas, from both a scientific and business perspective. Our goal is to build bridges between private and public partners, both in the Netherlands and abroad.</p><p> </p><p>In the field of flowers and food in particular, I am convinced the Netherlands has a lot to offer. In Europe 45 per cent of the applications for plant breeding rights come from the Netherlands. In China this is almost 70 per cent. And an enormous research effort is under way as the industry invests an average of 20 per cent of its turnover in research and development.</p><p>This brings me to my final point: the importance of plant breeding rights. Breakthroughs in research improve the wellbeing and prosperity of many and also provide inspiration. So in the end we all benefit from the work of the frontrunners. Acknowledging their intellectual property rights allows them to continue pioneering and to share their results.</p><p> </p><p>I believe that China's signature and implementation of the latest international agreements on plant breeding rights will give a tremendous boost to trade and scientific cooperation. It will also lead to the most exquisite Dutch plant varieties becoming available on the Chinese market.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>I hope that today's roundtable will prove fruitful and result in even closer cooperation between our two countries in innovation in green genetics.</p><p> </p><p>I have no doubt that your dialogue will lead to new and important results. I look forward to discussing them with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao on a subsequent occasion. So let's get to work.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",1
18,"<p>De toespraak is in het Engels gehouden:</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p>Tajikistan, Germany, Japan and the Netherlands have joined together to organise today's side event on drinking water and sanitation. The world is on track to meet the </p><p>MDG</p><p> drinking water target. For the first time in history the number of people with no access to safe drinking water has dropped below one billion.</p><p>However, the world is </p><p>not</p><p> 'on track' to meet the MDG sanitation target. Four out of ten people all over the world are without improved sanitation. Every year, around 1.5 million children die from diseases related to poor sanitation and hygiene and unsafe drinking water. Water is crucial for reaching the objectives on MDG 4 and 5 regarding child and maternal mortality. Many countries, especially in Africa, are confronted with an emergency situation. We need to step up our efforts considerably.</p><p>National governments have to take their responsibilities: one such responsibility is good national planning for water and sanitation as part of their overall development strategy. Investing in water and sanitation pays dividends. Every dollar invested generates nine dollars' worth of productive activity.</p><p>We in the Netherlands are trying to help our development partners achieve their national MDG targets on water and sanitation. The Netherlands is a country where water management is part of everyday life and crucial for our existence. We are willing to make our specific expertise available to others. This year the Netherlands recognised access to safe drinking water and sanitation as a basic human right. In our view, it is the obligation of each government to provide this for its citizens. In our dialogue with international organisations and with our partner countries the Netherlands will raise the issues of government responsibility for water and sanitation and the rights of citizens to access. I pay tribute to the work of the chair of the Secretary General's Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation (</p><p>UNSGAB</p><p>). Your efforts have made a huge difference.</p><p>I suggest four concrete actions to secure further progress:</p><p>First:</p><p> We need concerted action worldwide to keep or bring individual national MDG investment plans for water and sanitation 'on track'</p><p>;</p><p>Second:</p><p> we must give continued political and diplomatic support to international efforts to address water and sanitation issues</p><p>.</p><p>Third:</p><p> we should promote good integrated water resources management</p><p>;</p><p>Fourth:</p><p> we should establish a global Framework for Action with the following points:</p><p>The Dutch government is committed to helping provide access to safe drinking water and sanitation for at least 50 million people by 2015. We have signed various bilateral and multilateral agreements and agreements with civil society, and we have entered into public-private partnerships. I strongly believe that governments cannot solve these problems alone. The role of civil society and businesses is essential. These agreements will benefit almost 30 million people, at a cost of around 1.3 billion euros.</p><p>I invite other donor countries to do the same and commit themselves to the Framework for Action, ensuring adequate funding for water and sanitation. And I will do all I can to ensure that the donor community and international development partners respond generously to our renewed call to achieve the MDG water and sanitation targets. Together we can improve the health of millions of people in need, restore their dignity and bring them opportunities.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
19,"<p>De bijdrage ('intervention') van de minister-president is in het Engels uitgesproken:</p><p>Looking at Africa, we see a mixed picture. On the one hand good prospects, thanks to efforts of African and donor governments and economic growth. On the other hand there are multiple threats to development: rising food and fuel prices, climate change, instability within states and between states, and lack of progress on the MDGs. As the MDG Africa Steering Group pointed out, the current picture is far from satisfactory.</p><p>The Millennium Development Goals in Africa are an ambitious target. Reaching them will be far from easy, but there is no alternative. We are in this together. We must carry on until we have reached our common goal. One issue I have been advocating this week, together with Prime Minister Rudd of Australia, is the need to involve non-state players as crucial counterparts. Companies, non-governmental organizations and citizens themselves. We simply need more and stronger public-private partnerships</p><p>.</p><p>The Netherlands is firmly committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We are one of the few countries that really spends 0.8% of its GNI on Official Development Aid. In Africa, we spend around euro635 million a year on bilateral aid alone. And this is not counting our contributions through international organisations. For continued support in my country it is crucial that funds are having an impact on poverty reduction, that they are effective</p><p>.</p><p>Real</p><p> progress on human rights, good governance and the fight against corruption is essential. This includes democratisation, free press, and transparent power and wealth-sharing arrangements within African states and societies. They are a precondition for building stable African states in which economic progress is possible. Without this, states will remain potentially fragile.</p><p>It is an extra incentive for traditional donors, non-traditional donors like China and India, and African states themselves to give high priority to these good governance issues, alongside sustainable economic development and fair trade</p><p>.</p><p>Please allow me to make a remark on fragile states in Africa, because this issue has been on the agenda so very often in the last couple of years. The regional problems we face in the Great Lakes Region, Sudan, and the Horn of Arica are well known. In addition to this, the example of Kenya and the events in Ivory Coast have shown us that the stability of African states cannot be taken for granted.</p><p>I am particularly worried about progress on MDG 4 and 5. They need extra attention from all actors involved. The high levels of child mortality and the lack of progress on maternal health are clear indicators of the difference between rich and poor countries. We furthermore need a greater focus on improving access to clean water and sanitation. These areas are a priority in our development cooperation programmes.</p><p>Only a harmonised approach towards the issues I have mentioned will guarantee full success. Our governments again committed themselves to such a harmonised approach in Accra earlier this month. And it is my sincere hope that we will put this commitment into practice as soon as possible</p><p>.</p><p>Together we can - we must - make a difference.</p><p> </p>",3
20,"<p>(De toespraak is in het Engels gehouden)</p><p>Mr Oberman, </p><p>ladies and gentlemen</p><p>,</p><p>I'm delighted to be here with you today. The bond between the United States and the Netherlands is a truly special one. For me personally, as well as for the Dutch people</p><p>.</p><p>The United States is a source of inspiration and an example to the world in many ways.</p><p>Business pioneer Henry Ford summed up the positive American spirit when he said</p><p>:</p><p>Since the day it was founded, the United States has stood as a symbol of dynamism and belief in the future</p><p>. </p><p>I saw this for myself when I first got to know the country in 1985. At that time, I travelled around for four weeks as part of an exchange programme</p><p>.</p><p>And as the years have passed, my involvement with the US has grown stronger. I now travel there regularly. Next week, for example, I will be participating in the Bilderberg conference, near Washington.</p><p>You, as members of AmCham, serve as vital links between our countries. You are at home on both sides of the water</p><p>.</p><p>The Americans among you know about our little ways.</p><p>Take our national cuisine, in all its variety. With a bitter ball, oily ball, meat ball or soup ball in a starring role</p><p>.</p><p>Or take our passion for the colour orange. I'll warn you now: next month the European Football Championships begin, and you can expect to see that passion take on wild forms</p><p>.</p><p>And ladies and gentlemen, new research has recently turned the spotlight on another typical Dutch characteristic. This month a scholar presented her research on the factors that account for the success of Dutch businesses in the US</p><p>.</p><p>One of the key factors turned out to be our </p><p>informal</p><p> way of doing business</p><p>.</p><p>The most important decisions are made </p><p>before</p><p> a meeting starts, while standing by the coffee machine. And it seems this approach works well in America</p><p>.</p><p>It seems to me that, despite our minor cultural differences, American and Dutch people simply click. This is certainly true of business. And I have the figures to prove it</p><p>.</p><p>The mutual interest between the Netherlands and United States is frequently underestimated. In 2006, more US foreign direct investment went to the Netherlands than to </p><p>any</p><p> other country in the world. And in the opposite direction, the Netherlands' presence is just as strong in America. Seventeen per cent of all EU investment in the United States comes from the Netherlan</p><p>ds.</p><p>You could say the Netherlands is punching well above its weight</p><p>.</p><p>Some 440,000 American jobs have been generated as a result of Dutch investment in the United States. In the Netherlands some 200,000 people earn their living working for American companies based here</p><p>.</p><p>So we are talking not only about money and growth, but also about employment. And about hundreds of thousands of families that enjoy economic security as a result</p><p>.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, as members of the American Chamber of Commerce you are working to strengthen investment and trade between our countries. In doing so, you are honouring a long tradition. Two hundred and thirty years ago diplomat Benjamin Franklin was working for </p><p>precisely</p><p> the same thing when he stayed here in Amsterdam. His guiding principle was simple</p><p>:</p><p>And he saw the Netherlands as a shining example of this. Let me share with you this short quotation from Franklin's 'Thoughts on Commercial Subjects'</p><p>:</p><p>And indeed, openness has always been a driving force behind our prosperity. Since the time of Henry Hudson and the Dutch East India Company right up to the present day.</p><p>The Netherlands is not afraid of globalisation. On the contrary, globalisation presents us with extra opportunities</p><p>.</p><p>It is up to ús, however, to provide a healthy business climate for companies that wish to operate in the Netherlands. To ensure that we can compete with the best countries in Europe and beyond, so that companies want to come here, and stáy here</p><p>.</p><p>This continual challenge is one of our highest priorities. And it is a good thing we have organisations like yours to monitor our progress and be critical when necessary. You are the voice of the Dutch-American business community. It goes without saying that we listen carefully to what you have to say</p><p>.</p><p>Over the last few years, we have systematically strengthened our economy. With some impressive results</p><p>.</p><p>Yesterday I attended the launch of the Lisbon Scorecard at the Centre for European Reform. This British think tank called the Netherlands 'in many respects the EU's most successful economy'. The Netherlands is 'unique in the Union', according to the CER, because 'it combines high levels of productivity with a high employment rate'</p><p>.</p><p>We have worked very hard to give the Netherlands the best possible competitive edge. We have tackled the administrative burden on companies: the OECD has called us a 'front runner' in this respect. Reforms to our social security system are stimulating labour market participation and discouraging early retirement</p><p>.</p><p>I greatly appreciate the fact that AmCham has recognised these positive developments, and has even expressed its compliments in this year's Priority Points. You say that the course that has been set by the government is strengthening business confidence in the Netherlands. And you speak of 'a sense of dynamism'</p><p>. </p><p> </p><p>Marvellous words, ladies and gentlemen. But no reason to be content</p><p>.</p><p>We may be justified in being </p><p>self-confident</p><p>. But </p><p>self-satisfied</p><p>? Never</p><p>!</p><p>I would like to echo these wise words by Bill Gates. He said: 'Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.</p><p>'</p><p>We only have to read your priorities list to realise that there is still room for improvement</p><p>.</p><p>Quite rightly, you point to the job market in the Netherlands. We have to increase labour participation among the Dutch workforce</p><p>.</p><p>In the European Union our employment rate of 76 per cent is exceeded only by that of Denmark. We are not doing badly. At the same time, far too many people who </p><p>can</p><p> work are sitting on the sidelines. This is bad for them, and also for you. Good staff are becoming harder to find. In today's economy it's all hands on deck</p><p>.</p><p>More efforts are needed to ensure that everyone in this country is encouraged to bring out the best in themselves</p><p>.</p><p>To return to soccer for a moment, we need to get people </p><p>off</p><p> the bench and give them a chance on the field</p><p>.</p><p>I worry most about young people who do not get the stimulus they need at home. Families in which unemployment is passed down from generation to generation. Or families of new arrivals who have trouble finding a place in our society</p><p>.</p><p>There are too many young drop-outs in the Netherlands. Young people without a school diploma are going to miss out on the skills they need to make something of their lives</p><p>.</p><p>As you know, we want to halve the number of school drop-outs. But we cannot do this alone. The support of the business community is essential</p><p>.</p><p>To my mind, AmCham's initiative, 'Champs on Stage', is a good example of such support. You invite young students to get to know the practical side of your business. And this is not simply a school trip, but a chance to really learn the business, from the inside out</p><p>.</p><p>Students are introduced to the daily structure of a working week. They are guided and supported by mentors. They get the opportunity to take responsibility and discover their own talents. I truly hope that this programme can be extended to more schools and more companies</p><p>.</p><p>Another theme from your list of priorities is the need to further simplify Dutch tax legislation. I fully acknowledge the importance of a clear, fair and competitive tax system. And we must always remain alert to possibilities for improvement</p><p>.</p><p>On the other hand, only last month, research commissioned by AmCham </p><p>itself</p><p> suggested that, in general, this community is reasonably satisfied with the fiscal climate here</p><p>.</p><p>I promise you nonetheless, we will continue exploring ways of keeping our tax regime as attractive and as simple as possible.</p><p>Let me mention one last point from your priorities list: faster decision-making on necessary infrastructure. This is a subject dear to my own heart. As you know, the committee led by Peter Elverding recently made recommendations that could cut decision-making time by half. We cannot lose the momentum that has been gained here. The government will present proposals aimed at drastically speeding up the process.</p><p>My ambition is for the Netherlands to excel in </p><p>physical</p><p> infrastructure as it does in </p><p>virtual</p><p> infrastructure</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>We are one of the leading countries for broadband access. We have the world's fastest digital network for research and development. And we are home to the world's largest internet exchange point. We owe it to our reputation to offer the best possible facilities </p><p>above</p><p> ground too. Facilities for mobility, enterprise and information exchange. </p><p>Then</p><p> the Netherlands will truly be regarded as the 'Portal to Europe'</p><p>.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, our transatlantic bond is enormously valuable. A constant factor in our politics, our society and our business</p><p>.</p><p>This bond offers not only support, but dynamism too. Certainty and renewal. And it cuts both ways</p><p>.</p><p>I am very much looking forward to my trip to the US next week. Like you perhaps, I am fascinated by the festival of democracy the world is witnessing in the run-up to the presidential elections. I have every confidence that the new president will keep his or her sights fixed firmly on Europe, and indeed the Netherlands</p><p>.</p><p>In any case, our doors are always open to America</p><p>.</p><p>You </p><p>are</p><p>, and you will </p><p>remain</p><p>, welcome</p><p>!</p>",4
21,"<p>De toespraak is in het Engels uitgesproken</p><p>.</p><p>Mr President, distinguished delegates</p><p>,</p><p>I would like to begin by congratulating you, Mr Kerim, on your election as President of the General Assembly</p><p>.</p><p>I would also like to wish our Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moon, every success at his first full General Assembly since taking office. You have been very active in your first nine months. The Netherlands fully supports your efforts to promote peace and development in the world and to make the United Nations more effective</p><p>.</p><p>Mr President</p><p>,</p><p>I am convinced that the success or failure of the United Nations depends on three fundamental factors</p><p>.</p><p>The first is how much inspiration we draw from our common values: respect for human rights, for the rule of law and for our planet</p><p>.</p><p>The second is how much we shoulder our responsibility as members of the international community</p><p>.</p><p>And the third is how successful we are in making the United Nations more relevant, and increasing the impact of the international community</p><p>.</p><p>I will deal with each of these three themes in turn - respect, responsibility and relevance</p><p>.</p><p>Next year it will be sixty years since we adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the General Assembly. The values contained in this Declaration, and in the conventions based on it, are our source of inspiration</p><p>.</p><p>The Declaration sets out our mission: 'the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want'. For the last sixty years, these values have been our moral compass - our common standard of achievement</p><p>.</p><p>Whatever our differences of opinion, we must never lose sight of that common ideal. We all agree that every human being deserves a chance to build a good life</p><p>.</p><p>Respect for human rights and the rule of law is our deepest motive and our highest aspiration. Our diversity rests on this unity. We should not hesitate to hold one another to account</p><p>.</p><p>As we speak, the situation in one country in particular, calls for urgent action by the international community. In Birma, the military are shooting at monks and civilians, who are demonstrating peacefully. We strongly condemn this brutal use of force. Together with the European Union and the United States, we call on the Security Council to discuss the situation urgently and to consider further steps including sanctions</p><p>.</p><p>Should the Security Council not reach agreement, we will take our responsibility. In that case, I am convinced the European Union and the United States will decide on further measures, together with other well-intentioned countries</p><p>.</p><p>When it comes to human rights and rule of law, I am not talking about abstractions. Every child that can go to school, every family that can live in peace and freedom with its neighbours, every country that enjoys prosperity and tolerance - each of these is a step towards fulfilling our dream</p><p>.</p><p>Values connect us, across our cultures and religions. We must not allow cultural or religious differences to create barriers to open dialogue. Asma Jahangir, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Freedom of Religion, tells us that religious freedom is under threat in many parts of the world. So we have a lot to do</p><p>.</p><p>The Netherlands wants to join forces with all those who want to promote tolerance and dialogue between civilisations. But we must not allow this dialogue to put the universal validity of our common values in question</p><p>.</p><p>We know from experience how fundamental our shared values are. The Netherlands is one country in the world. But in a sense, we are also the world in one country. Our capital, Amsterdam, is home to one hundred and seventy-seven nationalities</p><p>.</p><p>We have learnt that only through unity in diversity can we make progress. Locally, nationally and internationally. This means that the rule of law must be strictly enforced, so that people can feel safe. It also means that we need to be more tolerant and willing to take a critical look at ourselves. Stressing our differences leads to polarisation and solves nothing</p><p>.</p><p>We owe respect not only to one another, but also to our planet. It gives us everything we need. Provided we treat its natural resources wisely and do not upset its natural balance. That is why sustainability is one of our most important values</p><p>.</p><p>A value is not something that we possess. It is not an achievement we can boast about. A value is a task, an incentive to action. Cherishing values automatically means: accepting responsibility</p><p>.</p><p>Mr President</p><p>,</p><p>Membership of the United Nations goes hand in hand with moral responsibility. It means more than attending meetings and even paying our dues. It also means keeping our commitments. The treaties we sign must not remain a dead letter. Human rights must be respected</p><p>.</p><p>The Netherlands is proud to contribute - for example as a member and vice-president of the Human Rights Council</p><p>.</p><p>In 2005 the United Nations adopted the principle of 'responsibility to protect'. In doing so, we sided with all those suffering from genocide or crimes against humanity. It is now time to put that principle into practice</p><p>.</p><p>The United Nations has a key responsibility as a protector of peace and security. Each of us shares this responsibility. In this age of rapid communications and global linkage, nothing is 'far away' anymore. What happens elsewhere affects us all</p><p>.</p><p>We can only secure lasting peace in areas of conflict if we combine defence with development and diplomacy. We are putting that concept into practice in the Afghan province of Uruzgan, together with our Australian partners and other allies. It is a difficult and demanding mission under </p><p>UN</p><p> mandate. The international community must not abandon Afghanistan to its fate. The hopes of millions of Afghans rest with us. The UN needs to broaden and intensify its role in Afghanistan</p><p>.</p><p>The Peacebuilding Commission has a vital role to play in bridging the gap between conflict and development. In the past year, it has worked hard to help several African countries on the difficult road of reconstruction, after being torn apart by conflict. The Netherlands is actively supporting this very promising approach, which focuses on prevention</p><p>.</p><p>Mr President</p><p>,</p><p>You have drawn attention to another responsibility we all share: the need for prompt action to tackle the problem of climate change. The industrialised countries - and that means all of them - should take the lead. But the countries that are now enjoying rapid economic growth are also being asked to develop more sustainably</p><p>.</p><p>The future lies with those countries that excel in energy conservation and the use of cleaner technologies. We are not yet making sufficient use of the scope that innovation offers us</p><p>.</p><p>The Netherlands wants to be a frontrunner. Not only in our ambition to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But also in developing new strategies to deal with the negative effects of climate change. It is important to take the climate and nature into account in all our investments. The most vulnerable developing countries deserve more support in tackling the problems they face</p><p>.</p><p>In December in Bali, the United Nations has a unique opportunity to take charge of the situation and create a united global framework for addressing the climate problem. European government leaders would like to see negotiations on a follow-up to Kyoto start in Bali. The Netherlands and its European partners will do all they can to accomplish this</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>Responsibility also means ongoing efforts to make the UN more relevant. The UN is the platform for seeking global solutions to global problems. The world needs an effective UN. How can we be more effective, efficient and credible</p><p>?</p><p>We need to strengthen the rule of law and put an end to impunity. We are not yet making full use of the instruments we have. I say this as Prime Minister of a country that is proud to have the legal capital of the world - The Hague - within its borders. Without justice, there can be no lasting peace and no reconciliation</p><p>.</p><p>We would like to see the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court accepted more widely. We stress the need for cooperation by both Member and non-Member States with the International Criminal Court in general and with regard to the execution of arrest warrants in particular</p><p>.</p><p>The Netherlands will continue to make a special effort to promote the international legal order. That is why we have responded positively to the Secretary-General's request to host the Lebanon tribunal in the Netherlands. Preparations for this tribunal are in full swing</p><p>.</p><p>Enforcing the rule of law is not enough to make the UN more relevant. We also need to keep a critical eye on how we work</p><p>.</p><p>Let us resist the temptation to invest too much energy in resolutions we adopt every year. It is better to invest in strengthening confidence between North and South, West and East. People and resources are scarce. We can only spend each euro once. If we want to achieve our common aims, like the Millennium Development Goals, we need to coordinate our efforts</p><p>.</p><p>Several dozen UN agencies are active around the world. We have planted a forest of </p><p>UN</p><p> flags in various countries. We need a more unified approach in order to help the poorest developing countries more</p><p>.</p><p>We can work far more efficiently if we pool our resources in a single programme in each country. This makes demands on donors. Several countries - including the Netherlands - now fund various UN organisations on the basis of multiyear plans. I hope that others will follow suit</p><p>.</p><p>The Netherlands supports the Secretary-General's efforts to reform the UN system and the Security Council. Reforms are never easy, but they are essential. In a world that is changing at breakneck speed, we need multilateral institutions that can respond to new developments. A relevant UN means a dynamic UN with dynamic institutions</p><p>.</p><p>Mr President</p><p>,</p><p>Reforms are sometimes seen as giving up certainties. I am convinced that we need to reform in order to safeguard what we all hold dear: respect for human rights; enforcement of the rule of law; and sustainable development for all nations. These values are the lifeblood of the UN</p><p>.</p><p>Respect for our values means taking joint responsibility. Responsibility means a constant effort to make the United Nations more relevant</p><p>.</p><p>We want our values to take concrete form in the twenty-first century. In people's lives and in international relations. This demands unity of purpose, courage and resolution of us all. Above all it requires ambition. The ambition to make a determined effort - while respecting our differences - to realise our common ideals. What we need in the 21st century is: united values, united ideals, a united world and the United Nations</p><p>.</p><p>Thank you</p><p>.</p>",1
22,"<p>Mr Mandel, ladies and gentlemen</p><p>,</p><p>It is a great pleasure to meet you this morning here in Edmonton</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>You might think that my country, the Netherlands, is far away. But consider this. Immigrants of Dutch origin and their families make up the fifth largest population group in Canada. That group includes Alberta's agriculture minister George Groeneveld</p><p>.</p><p>And the Dutch are the fourth largest investors. So we are closer than you might think</p><p>.</p><p>This is certainly the case today, with the many Dutch companies that are visiting here</p><p>.</p><p>Sixteen million people live in the Netherlands, a country which is slightly bigger than Vancouver Island. It is located in the most dynamic part of Europe. The pressure on each square metre is great. And at the same time people in the Netherlands demand a high quality living environment. They want clean air, clean water, clean soil and beautiful nature. And they want protection from flooding. This is no small undertaking in a country where more than half the land is below sea level</p><p>.</p><p>We are also an energy producing country, with considerable gas reserves. The Netherlands was one of the first countries to exploit its reserves on a large scale</p><p>.</p><p>These circumstances have forced us to be creative. We have extensive know-how that could be applied to the sustainable development of the energy supplies here in Alberta</p><p>.</p><p>Alberta is committed to developing its oilfields. It needs to do so to ensure energy security. Demand for oil and gas is rising sharply, while the global supply is only just sufficient. Alternative sources of energy are emerging all the time, but not quickly enough</p><p>.</p><p>But we all know that there is a downside to oil extraction here in Alberta</p><p>.</p><p>Extraction from oil-bearing sand requires a great deal of energy and generates substantial emissions. The landscape suffers and large quantities of water are needed. This is not news to you of course</p><p>.</p><p>If the challenges on energy and climate can be seen and felt anywhere, then it is here in Alberta. Alberta is witnessing a fierce debate on energy security and sustainability</p><p>.</p><p>That's why I am here, because I also see these as key issues. And because I'm convinced that we can do a lot for each other, that we can achieve more together</p><p>.</p><p>First, politically. Yesterday I had a meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper. I told him that Europeans greatly appreciate Canada's membership of the international coalition of countries pursuing an ambitious climate policy. Later today, I will also meet with Premier Ed Stelmach. He's looking for new ways to make oil extraction more sustainable, and I'm very interested to find out more about that</p><p>.</p><p>Second, we share a great deal of common ground in our research into energy and sustainability. I'll be exploring this when I visit the University of Alberta later on</p><p>.</p><p>Third, there are lots of opportunities for cooperation with and between companies. That's something we'll be looking into at this meeting</p><p>.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen</p><p>,</p><p>I'd like to highlight something Premier Stelmach said in April at a conference of the Canadian Energy Research Institute</p><p>.</p><p>He said that his government was stepping up its efforts to balance Alberta's role as a key energy supplier with the equally important role of safeguarding the environment. He also said that he was committed to working with industry to find innovative solutions</p><p>.</p><p>That is an important message. It points us in the right direction</p><p>.</p><p>Clearly not all oil-rich nations show this degree of political openness. Canada is one of the few that does. Canada wants to work constructively with others. To seek out new ways to combine energy security and sustainability</p><p>.</p><p>We have the same open standpoint in the Netherlands</p><p>.</p><p>We are a highly developed country: number five on the Human Development Index, one place below Canada. The question we now face is this: how can we stay at the leading edge, so that we remain successful in the future</p><p>?</p><p>The answer is sustainability. We are convinced that we can make sustainability our strength. In economic terms too. After all, how will we earn a living in the future? Not by doing what everyone else is already doing. That's a battle we can't win. But by devising more sustainable solutions that enable continued development and growth. Smart technologies and innovative governance. That's what the world will need</p><p>.</p><p>The future belongs to sustainability experts</p><p>.</p><p>My government has bold ambitions. By 2020, we want to cut greenhouse gas emissions at home by 30% compared to 1990. We also want to work with other countries, to see how we can move forward together. Not telling each other what to do, but helping each other move in the right direction</p><p>.</p><p>We are doing this both through the EU and bilaterally. In the places where the challenges posed by energy and climate are most clear. Like Alberta</p><p>.</p><p>Innovation is the key. I am pleased to see a number of innovative Dutch entrepreneurs here today. Many Dutch companies are strong in the sectors that are so vital here. Let me briefly run through four sectors represented here today</p><p>.</p><p>First, soil management and soil remediation</p><p>.</p><p>This may sound strange, but a large part of the Netherlands is man-made. We are a nation of engineers. They have literally made our country what it is. This ""can-do"" mentality is in our blood. It starts at a very young age. The best present you can give a small Dutch child is a pair of rubber boots for playing in the mud and a spade for digging.</p><p>Large parts of the Netherlands used to be under water. We understand the art of turning sea and lakebeds into fertile farmland. And transforming areas used for intensive livestock farming into woods and wetlands</p><p>.</p><p>We have more than 30 years' practical experience in the field of soil remediation. And we have learned that our most faithful ally is Mother Nature herself. Since the 1990s, we have increasingly been using natural processes in the soil to combat contamination. Ecosystems have the power to recover. If we only give them the chance</p><p>.</p><p>The ground can also help us to tackle climate change. The Canadian government is experimenting with carbon storage in depleted oil and gas fields. This could be an important way to achieve climate ambitions. The Netherlands wants to help by starting one or two demonstration projects in the near future. We should get together to work out where the opportunities lie</p><p>.</p><p>The second sector I want to mention is water management and water treatment. The Netherlands is a land of water. We have had to cope with an abundance of water from the earliest times up to the present day. We are proud that our water management expertise is called upon all over the world. In Louisiana, for example, after Hurricane Katrina</p><p>.</p><p>In recent decades we have done a lot to clean up our rivers, lakes and canals. But we need to do more. That is why we are committed to developing new technologies, such as membrane technology and biological treatment of large waste water streams. They offer excellent prospects for further improving our performance. And they can help us treat water used in oil production</p><p>.</p><p>The third sector in which the Netherlands has considerable experience is spatial planning</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>A hot topic in Alberta where enormous investments are being made</p><p>. </p><p>Tens of thousands of people are coming here to work and to live. That will radically change the landscape</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>These developments open a great window of opportunity for Alberta. It is important now to think about the future. To make plans that combine economic development, housing, transport, and a healthy and attractive living environment. To ensure that the people who come to Alberta today - and their children - will still enjoy living and working here in twenty years' time</p><p>.</p><p>Alberta is fifteen times the size of the Netherlands. But the Netherlands has five times as many people. We have vast experience with spatial planning and sustainable solutions to maintain the living environment. And we want to share that experience with you</p><p>.</p><p>The fourth sector I want to mention is waste management. More people means more waste. Is this a problem? No, it is an opportunity</p><p>. </p><p>In the Netherlands, we find a good use for over 80% of our waste. We recycle it, or use it to generate power</p><p>.</p><p>Back in the early 1980s, the rate of 'green recovery' was a lot lower. Half of our waste stream was not re-used. So we have made great progress in the last 25 years</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>Landfills have rapidly disappeared from the Dutch landscape. We have only been able to achieve this by adopting an approach in which the public and private sectors have joined forces</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>In the past, governments and markets used to be on opposite teams. Regulations versus short-term profit</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>Those days are over</p><p>.</p><p>Our message should not be that economic growth is bad for the climate and the environment.</p><p> </p><p>Our message should be that the climate requires us to achieve growth in a different way. More cleanly and more efficiently</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>If we want to safeguard development and energy supply, we have to think in terms of sustainability</p><p>.</p><p>There are big rewards for the pioneers. So let's be creative. And let's work together to ensure that the right choices are made</p><p>.</p><p>Thank you</p><p>.</p>",3
23,"<p>Madame Darling, Mesdames, Messieurs</p><p>,</p><p>Je suis heureux d'être aujourd'hui votre hôte dans ce beau pays, cette ville dynamique à l'occasion de cette conference organisée par votre institut réputé. J'espère que cette heure passée en votre compagnie sera l'occasion d'un échange productif</p><p>.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen</p><p>,</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Recently, a very interesting documentary was broadcast on Dutch television. It was a 'wartime road movie', made by Canadian soldiers in 1944 and 1945. They filmed the landing on D-Day and recorded the difficult advance of the Canadian army</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>We see all those young men landing on the Normandy coast; passing through ruined villages, along muddy roads. We see them mourn their fallen comrades</p><p>.</p><p>In the autumn of 1944, they arrived in </p><p>my</p><p> country. In Zeeland there were fierce battles. That is the province where I was born</p><p>.</p><p>I know the fields, dikes and villages that the Canadians captured on film. For them, it was a scene from hell. For me - twenty years later - it was the backdrop to a happy childhood in a free country</p><p>.</p><p>I heard an interesting story of one of the Canadian troopers, who was in Zeeland at that time</p><p>.</p><p>Charly Forbes was involved in the battle for Walcheren Island. 135 men of the Canadian 5 th brigade were killed or wounded during the three days the battle lasted. Charly Forbes was involved in several brave actions. Amidst the chaos of fighting, he took care of a wounded soldier, while the rest of his buddies were out of reach</p><p>.</p><p>I was told he had to wade through the mud, with a wounded comrade on his back. And I was told a Dutch family took them into their home, offering help and shelter in the storm of war</p><p>.</p><p>Charly Forbes, who received the highest Dutch Military honour, is here today. I am glad to see him and proud to shake his hand</p><p>.</p><p>The Canadians didn't only film the fighting. They also filmed the outpourings of joy in liberated towns and villages. The cheering crowds lining the roads, not even minding their toes being run over</p><p>.</p><p>We see Canadian soldiers on ice skates, with four Dutch girls trailing from each arm. Canadians joining in the Saint Nicolas festivities. A soldier doing a magic trick for amazed children. A little boy, lifted up by a Canadian officer, glowing with pride</p><p>.</p><p>The documentary gave us a glimpse of the Netherlands in 1945, as seen through the eyes of young Canadians. That made it both fascinating and moving</p><p>.</p><p>The soldiers' song, too, sent shivers down my spine</p><p>:</p><p> </p><p>Our collective memory in the Netherlands is that we were liberated by the Canadians.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, other Allied forces also played a vital role. But the Canadians have a special place in our hearts, even today</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>A few years ago, there was a major international survey into countries' reputations. People were asked: 'Suppose a young person who wanted to leave your country asked you to recommend where to go to lead a good life - what country would you recommend</p><p>?'</p><p>Dutch participants overwhelmingly named two countries: Canada and Australia</p><p>.</p><p>Not only because we still see Canadians as our liberators. But also because of your country's vast scale. Imagine: Canada is two hundred and sixty times the size of the Netherlands. But it has only twice our population. If we look at a map of the world, some people might struggle to locate the Netherlands, while Canada is impossible to miss. We are fascinated by the boundless space, the freedom, and the opportunities</p><p>.</p><p>After the Second World War, more than two hundred thousand Dutch men and women emigrated to Canada. Today, nearly a million of the 33 million Canadians are of Dutch descent. Nearly everyone in the Netherlands has an uncle, aunt or cousin in Canada</p><p>.</p><p>Dutch immigrants helped make Canada what it is today: one of the most developed, happiest nations in the world. A nation of which Canadians can rightly be proud</p><p>.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have close historical ties. But will our relationship be just as close in the future</p><p>?</p><p>Before that question can be answered, we must address another issue. As free countries with a medium-sized population, what is our role on the global stage</p><p>?</p><p>The context is changing fast. And major changes are taking place within our own borders. What is our ambition at the present time? Can we make a difference? Do we want to</p><p>?</p><p>Questions like this are being asked in the Netherlands, and in Canada. Sometimes, they arise out of uncertainty. Sometimes, they lead to heated discussions about our role</p><p>.</p><p>I get the feeling we can help each other find answers to these questions. Because we have a lot in common. We are idealists, but we have our feet planted firmly on the ground</p><p>.</p><p>I would like to share with you the Netherlands' ideas about what we feel our role should be. And how we view our relationship with Canada. A relationship in which we work together and learn from each other</p><p>.</p><p>I</p><p>will discuss this on the basis of four themes</p><p>:</p><p> </p><p>Just two countries make up the North American continent. The European continent is made up of nearly fifty countries</p><p>.</p><p>Most of European history is marked by conflicts - in changing coalitions. Twice, Canadian soldiers crossed the Atlantic and sacrificed many lives to restore peace and stability on our continent</p><p>.</p><p>Those turbulent times are over. In the last sixty years, peace and stability have spread across Europe. The European Union is now made up of 27 countries. Nearly half of these were still dictatorships in the 1970's</p><p>.</p><p>The strength of the European Union is that it doesn't force its ideas on countries, it wins them over and brings about transformation from within</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>European integration has been called one of the most successful projects in the history of mankind. And I would not disagree with that</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>The European Union wants to be a positive model. A community of independent nations who share fundamental values and work together peacefully on issues that transcend national territories. The European Union is based not on the rule of might, but on the rule of law</p><p>.</p><p>The Netherlands is one of the six founding nations of the European Union. Recent polls have shown that three-quarters of the Dutch support EU membership</p><p>.</p><p>'But what about your country's rejection of the European constitutional treaty?', I hear you ask. The 'no' vote was not based on anti-European sentiment. It was prompted by the fear of a European super-state</p><p>.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I know that Canadians sometimes regard the European Union with mixed feelings. Over the years, the EU has become a complex institution. It can be difficult to figure out who is in charge, and who to call</p><p>.</p><p>There are many areas in which Canada and the European Union work together to mutual advantage. Areas such as human rights, poverty reduction and sustainable development.</p><p> </p><p>Canada has always been a steady partner for Europe even as the EU expanded. I am strongly in favour of an ongoing intensive dialogue between the EU and Canada.</p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, a dialogue between Canada and the EU does not remove the need for intensive bilateral contacts. There is a lot that we can learn from each other</p><p>.</p><p>The second theme I want to talk about illustrates this perfectly:</p><p>Canada has always welcomed large numbers of newcomers. After the Second World War, your country was the most popular destination of Dutch emigrants. Outside the Netherlands, Canada has the largest population of ethnic Dutch in the world</p><p>.</p><p>And they are doing well here! The Dutch Social Insurance Bank recently found that Dutch immigrants in Canada live longer than Dutch people elsewhere. That is pretty remarkable</p><p>.</p><p>What's your secret? Dutch people here tell me that it's a combination of factors: the space, the natural beauty, clean air, friendly people and the outdoor lifestyle</p><p>.</p><p>But I think there is more to it than that. People are happy here. Canada excels in integrating minorities. As a nation of immigrants, you have a rich and interesting tradition in which newcomers are given the space to be themselves, but in which Canada also expects something in return. It's a two-way deal. Canada welcomes immigrants, but also asks them to take part in Canadian life</p><p>.</p><p>Canadians are proud of what they call the Canadian mosaic. Of course, I realise it is not paradise on earth here, either. With so many different groups of people living in one place, there are problems. There are bound to be. But your approach still holds many lessons for us. The Netherlands is also a country of many cultures. Nearly half the residents of Amsterdam and Rotterdam - our two largest cities - are newcomers</p><p>.</p><p>For a long time, integration was not adequately addressed in the Netherlands. Pim Fortuyn was one of the people who put the problems of a multicultural society high on the agenda. It is clear that a multicultural society does not automatically function smoothly. It was an enormous shock to us when filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered in 2004 by a young Dutch Moslim radical. People could hardly believe that something like that could happen in the Netherlands</p><p>.</p><p>It is my conviction that diversity gives a country strength and creativity. But there </p><p>must</p><p> be a foundation of shared values, a basis which guarantees a peaceful growth of diversity. Without this foundation, society would fall apart. That is why I would like to hear about your experiences of working to achieve unity amid diversity</p><p>.</p><p>There is one tradition that we have already copied from you. New Canadian citizens take part in a citizenship ceremony. That is a way to express inclusion and pride in being Canadian. The Netherlands has adopted this excellent custom</p><p>.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, there is another pressing issue which requires our joint effort</p><p>: H</p><p>ow will we limit climate change, while securing our energy supply?</p><p>You will understand why this question has my particular concern, when you consider that more than half my country lies below sea level. In fact, I myself live quite close to the lowest-lying part of the country - nearly seven metres below sea level</p><p>!</p><p>But a lot is at stake in Canada, too. Over the last 40 years, a large part of Canada has warmed up by between one and three degrees. And we are starting to see the effects and risks of this warm-up: more heat waves, more smog and melting ice caps</p><p>.</p><p>Sustainability is one of the pillars of my government's national and international policy. Sustainability is not the icing on the cake, but the crucial ingredient. It is embedded in our thinking and our actions</p><p>.</p><p>The Netherlands aims to reduce energy consumption by 2% per year. As for greenhouse gas emissions, we are aiming at a reduction of 30% in 2020 compared to 1990 levels</p><p>.</p><p>We would prefer to achieve these goals in a united effort with our European partners. Europe is also prepared to go for 30% if other major energy-consuming countries join in</p><p>.</p><p>These are ambitious targets, ladies and gentlemen. But the situation demands it</p><p>.</p><p>You probably know the latest figures. Global greenhouse gas emissions have grown by three per cent a year since 2000. In the 1990s, this was only one per cent per year</p><p>.</p><p>The emerging economies of China and India are largely responsible for this increase. But we cannot make demands of them if we do not make every effort ourselves</p><p>.</p><p>There is a lot that we can do. Instead of waiting for others to make a move, we can take the lead. In energy efficiency. Innovation. Smart technologies</p><p>.</p><p>The winners of tomorrow will not be the largest polluters, but those with the know-how to make their societies cleaner. The Netherlands is determined to be one of the frontrunners</p><p>.</p><p>Tomorrow, I will be going to Alberta to learn more about the Canadian situation, about the challenges your country faces. In view of your own energy needs and global energy security, it is only natural that you are exploiting your oil reserves. But, as our two countries agree, the challenge is to minimise or offset the damage to the environment</p><p>.</p><p>The Netherlands has a lot of expertise in this field and we would be happy to share it. We know a lot about water management, soil remediation and soil management, new methods for underground carbon storage… to name only a few subjects. In Alberta tomorrow, I will be exploring how we might assist Canada in contributing to a cleaner planet</p><p>.</p><p>This brings me to my fourth and last theme, ladies and gentlemen</p><p>:</p><p>Do you want to know what I believe is the most impressive Canadian invention of the last 50 years</p><p>?</p><p>No, not the BlackBerry, although it does rate very highly with me! I don't know how I ever managed without it</p><p>.</p><p>The most impressive Canadian invention, in my opinion, is not a thing but an idea, a vision. It is the concept of the 3 Ds: Defence, Diplomacy and Development</p><p>.</p><p>In today's world, weapons alone cannot guarantee security. Security and stability can only be achieved through a broader approach. One in which defence, diplomacy and development go hand in hand. All of these elements are necessary in order to achieve lasting results</p><p>.</p><p>This vision also underlies Dutch policy</p><p>.</p><p>Canada and the Netherlands are part of a large group of countries who do not only preach involvement, but also practise it. We have both played an active role, and sometimes a leading one, in fighting the spread of small arms and light weapons and in promoting human security</p><p>.</p><p>We worked together during UN peace missions in the Balkans, where we found that we got on very well.</p><p>Now, we are partners in Afghanistan, a country burdened by its history of repression, terror, conflict and poverty. And by its years as an outcast from the international community</p><p>.</p><p>I have deep respect for the spirit and determination with which the Canadian forces in Kandahar and elsewhere are doing their work. I understand your feelings of loss for the fifty-seven soldiers killed during this mission. The grief of the Canadian families who have lost loved ones touches me and my countrymen, too</p><p>.</p><p>The Netherlands is honoured to be working with Canada on achieving peace and security in Afghanistan. About eighteen hundred Dutch men and women are stationed in Uruzgan, Kandahar and Kabul. We know, as you do, that it is vital to convince people at home of the importance of this mission. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world. Transforming a devastated country into a prosperous democratic nation is not something that can be done overnight. It takes time</p><p>.</p><p>For every two steps forward, we are often forced to take one step back. There are no quick wins. But one thing is certain: pessimism will not help us. And there are enough hopeful signs to keep us going</p><p>.</p><p>Afghanistan has one of the freest societies in the region. It has an independent press and functioning democratic institutions. Its GNP doubled in only five years. Five million Afghan children have returned to school. Sixty-five thousand land mines have been cleared. More than one thousand wells have been drilled. One hundred and fifty kilometres of new road have been built in Kandahar. And there are four hundred 'cash for work' projects in Uruzgan</p><p>.</p><p>ISAF is settling in all over the country. In the troubled Southern provinces, the Taliban are under pressure</p><p>.</p><p>We know that NATO can't manage on its own in Afghanistan. The EU, the UN and international development organisations must make a heavier footprint. We are pleased that the EU is starting a police mission in Afghanistan this week, in which Canada will also be participating</p><p>.</p><p>The next step should be more UN offices and more UN programmes in the south of the country. After all, ISAF was mandated by the UN. And the Afghan government itself should send more troops and police units to the South. It needs to create a stronger presence there and introduce better governance. This a crucial component of our transfer strategy</p><p>.</p><p>Eleven NATO allies are now active in southern Afghanistan. As the secretary-general of NATO said, the operation is more than a litmus test of NATO's relevance in the twenty-first century. It is also a test of the strength of solidarity within the alliance. It should be clear that the Netherlands is already operating at the limits of its military capacity in Uruzgan</p><p>.</p><p>There is no doubt that reconstructing Afghanistan will require the long-term involvement of the international community. The Afghan people deserve to live in peace and security. And we all stand to benefit from a stable Afghanistan that maintains friendly relations with its neighbours</p><p>.</p><p>The international community cannot abandon this country. It would be irresponsible. We have been active in the Balkans for fifteen years. And for thirty years in Cyprus and in the Middle East. By contrast, international involvement in Afghanistan only goes back to 2001</p><p>.</p><p>In the Netherlands, we will have to decide this summer if we will continue to participate in ISAF after August 2008. And if so, how. The decision will be made after careful deliberation and discussion. Naturally, we will maintain close contact with Canada and our other allies during this process</p><p>.</p><p>It is too early for me to say at this stage what the outcome of this process will be. Whatever is decided, our development efforts will continue until the end of 2009</p><p>.</p><p>As one of the world's poorest countries, Afghanistan can rely on the Netherlands' commitment. Yet at the same time, we should not ignore the enormous distress in other parts of the world. Particularly in a number of African countries, where circumstances also require the involvement of the international community (including the Netherlands) in the form of 3D missions. Defence, diplomacy, development</p><p>.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, Canada and the Netherlands are not leaders in terms of population size. But I am convinced that we do make a difference</p><p>.</p><p>Our influence is not derived from threats and power play, but from our ability to see things from other people's perspective. From an innovative approach. From our willingness to participate in both thinking up solutions and carrying them out. We do all this because we are responsible nations. And because we believe in the values that unite us: freedom, human rights, respect for our planet and all its natural resources</p><p>.</p><p>It is this shared conviction that causes us to link up again and again in the international arena. Let's keep working together. Let's keep learning from each other. In the areas of social cohesion, sustainability, and stability and security, two can achieve more than one</p><p>.</p><p>Our goals may seem to lie on a distant horizon. But we must keep in mind the song that the Canadian soldiers sang in 1944, when they landed in Normandy</p><p>:</p><p>Fortunately, those young men were prepared to take that long, long trail</p><p>.</p><p>Considering our freedom and prosperity now, we also have a duty to stay the course</p><p>.</p><p>That is our task in our global society</p><p>.</p><p>Thank you</p><p>.</p>",0
24,"<p>Mr Frattini, Mrs Michiels van Kessenich, Mr Tjeenk Willink, </p><p>ladies and gentlemen</p><p>,</p><p>On behalf of the Dutch government I would like to welcome you to The Hague. Today and tomorrow, you will be discussing security, human rights and accountability. This city - the legal capital of the world - is the perfect place to do so. I would like to thank the Review Committee on the Intelligence and Security Services for organising this international symposium</p><p>.</p><p>We are now in the Ridderzaal, at the centre of the Binnenhof. The Dutch parliament has been meeting in the heart of The Hague for more than four centuries. It is here that Dutch democracy grew into its present form</p><p>.</p><p>This was a complex process, as it is for every democratic nation. A process that was and is driven by competing values and interests. Some of these values are central to the agenda of this symposium: security, openness, and respect for individual freedom and human rights</p><p>.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen</p><p>,</p><p>Recently, a survey was conducted on the occasion of the fifth of May, Dutch Liberation Day. This year's theme was 'Freedom from fear', one of the four freedoms advocated by President Roosevelt in his famous speech to Congress in 1941</p><p>.</p><p>One thousand Dutch people were asked to name the values we share in this country. The four values most often mentioned were: democracy, freedom, human rights and security</p><p>.</p><p>'</p><p>Not very surprising,' you might think</p><p>.</p><p>But people were then asked a follow-up question: 'What would you choose? More security, at the expense of freedom? Or more freedom, at the expense of security</p><p>?'</p><p>The outcome was striking. Almost half the participants chose 'more security'. Only one in five chose 'more freedom'</p><p>.</p><p>It would seem that many people perceive security to be more important than freedom. That, at least, was the researchers' conclusion</p><p>.</p><p>Citizens expect the government to protect them from threats and risks. Safeguarding security is a core task of government. It is a government's </p><p>duty</p><p> to protect its citizens when their security is threatened. The legal basis for this duty lies in the obligation to protect the right to life, set out in article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights</p><p>.</p><p>For most of the twentieth century it was clear where the danger lay. The Cold War simplified our world view. The biggest threat came from beyond our borders</p><p>.</p><p>But since the fall of the Wall and the attacks of 11 September 2001, things have changed. The biggest threat now comes from within. It lies in secret terrorist networks and shadowy international criminal organisations, operating at the heart of our society</p><p>.</p><p>That unsettles people. As the English expression goes, 'Better the devil you know than the devil you don't'</p><p>.</p><p>A shift has taken place in what people expect from their government. And in society's acceptance of security measures put in place by that government</p><p>.</p><p>Privacy was long an unshakable norm. Not only in the domestic sphere, but also in public. Cameras in the street? Many saw that as an Orwellian nightmare</p><p>.</p><p>These days, cameras are no longer questioned. In shops. At stations. In cafés. And not just in the Netherlands. Also in Great Britain, France and many other countries with a long, well-established tradition of civil rights</p><p>.</p><p>Citizens sacrifice privacy in the interests of security. Many do not seem to have a problem with that. This attitude should make us stop and think</p><p>.</p><p>At this time of heightened security, clear rules and good oversight are more important than ever. We must not lose sight of the balance between security and civil rights</p><p>.</p><p>In order to protect our open society, we sometimes need to work behind closed doors. That is one of the great paradoxes of democracy</p><p>.</p><p>When people feel unsafe, social trust and cohesion are eroded. This leads to fear, distrust, aggression and widening social rifts.</p><p> </p><p>That is why, following an attack, there is always a loud call for action. And that is why security interests must always be at the forefront of our thoughts</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>The European Convention on Human Rights stipulates that rights and freedoms </p><p>can</p><p> be limited in the interests of national security and public order. But these limitations must always be made in accordance with the law</p><p>.</p><p>A democracy like ours is constantly seeking to strike the right balance between competing values. As transparently as possible. And guided by the rule of law</p><p>.</p><p>Independent safeguards are vital if we are to succeed in this mission. Security services must be open to oversight and inspection. And national parliaments must be allowed to observe how they operate. Only then can there be lasting trust in the rule of law</p><p>.</p><p>Maximum secrecy demands maximum accountability</p><p>.</p><p>Moreover, good oversight is in the security services' own interest. It gives them a better sense of how to perform their challenging, important duties, in the interests of democracy and the rule of law</p><p>.</p><p>The principles that guide domestic intelligence and security work also apply abroad. There is no reason why they shouldn't. Intelligence-gathering is a vital part of ensuring peace, security and reconstruction. But it must take place under the watchful eye of the committees established for that purpose</p><p>.</p><p>We need to realise that this is a delicate balancing act. Constant vigilance is necessary. Discussions of freedom and the trade-offs between privacy and security will become increasingly common</p><p>.</p><p>Last month I took part in a debate on this very subject with young people from different countries. I was struck by how much interest there was in this issue and how many emotions it stirred up</p><p>.</p><p>Experts and civil society representatives are also closely involved in the debate. They rightly point to new technology for maintaining social control, storing information and exchanging data</p><p>.</p><p>In the past we had filing cabinets and fingerprints</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>Now we have microchips and </p><p>DNA</p><p> profiles</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>With a press of a button we can send entire databases to the other side of the world</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>The newest security gates can scan a person in seconds</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>These technologies have major advantages. But there are also risks. Some warn of a police state, a Big Brother scenario</p><p>.</p><p>We must take this concern seriously. At a time when most people are pressing for security, politicians need to keep an eye on the possible consequences and ensure that the right balance is maintained. Reports produced by independent oversight committees are very useful in this respect</p><p>.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen</p><p>,</p><p>No single model for democratic oversight of security services works in every country. The right system for any given country is determined by its history, form of government and political culture</p><p>.</p><p>National security entails national security services and national committees. But that does not mean we can't learn from each other. We need to share experiences. Exchange ideas. Discuss new developments and scientific research</p><p>.</p><p>The exact choices we make may vary from country to country. But the underlying </p><p>values</p><p> remain the same: freedom, respect for human rights, protection of life and the rule of law</p><p>.</p><p>Benjamin Franklin once said, 'Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety</p><p>.'</p><p>How do we find, and keep, the right balance? Only through maintaining democratic standards and ensuring that they are subject to oversight</p><p>.</p><p>Your contribution to this debate is vital. I wish you all an inspiring symposium</p><p>!</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
25,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Today, the world’s eyes are once again on Paris. I admire the people of this city for their resilience and determination. This conference shows that − no matter how hard it was hit on that black day a few weeks ago – la ville lumière ne recule jamais. It’s good to be here.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Voltaire − the great French Enlightenment philosopher – once wrote: ‘Men argue. Nature acts.’ I believe these words hold a truth and a challenge to all of us at this summit. Because the truth is that climate change is nature’s active response to modern-day life. </p><p>The Kingdom of the Netherlands, both in Europe and the Caribbean, is fully committed to the goal of keeping global warming below two degrees Celsius. I’s important to adapt to the effects of climate change. The two goals − climate neutrality and climate resilience – go hand in hand. </p><p>So how can we achieve those goals? What are the critical success factors? I’ll give you three:</p><p>First, every country needs to focus on measurable national targets. Our efforts must lead to a legally binding climate agreement that addresses the causes and effects of climate change. </p><p>Second, that agreement needs to be flexible and dynamic. It needs to take account of the great diversity of nations and the developments in each of them. The traditional divide between rich and poor and north and south is no longer all defining. Countries’ capabilities change. And it’s important that each contributes according to their ability. The Kingdom of the Netherlands takes this responsibility in climate finance seriously. In 2010-2014 we contributed 800 million euro, and Dutch climate finance will continue to grow to 550 million in 2016.</p><p>And third, there needs to be a bigger role for companies, consumers, cities and civil society organisations. Climate policy can only work if it penetrates to the deepest roots of our society and people’s behaviour. For that to happen we need every conceivable party to work together – nationally and internationally. </p><p>Let me give you a concrete example of a project that the Netherlands has a special connection with: the International Delta Coalition, in which vulnerable urban deltas from around the world share their knowledge and experience. Not only governments, but also companies, knowledge institutions and NGOs. </p><p>So, ladies and gentlemen. Let’s act. Let’s act together. And let’s act now!  </p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
26,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Thank you for your warm welcome and for the opportunity to speak at this important forum.</p><p>Today I heard that Japan is going for gold in 2020. But I’m not talking about medals in athletics, gymnastics or table tennis. This time it’s something completely different. By the time it hosts the Olympic Games here in Tokyo, Japan wants to be the world’s most advanced country in ICT. That’s a commendable ambition.</p><p>And it’s certainly not beyond Japan’s reach. After all, this is the country that gave us Sony, the QR code and the selfie stick. Koichi Endo, Japan’s Chief Information Officer, has outlined some inspiring challenges, like wireless charging systems and extending free Wi-Fi to the very top of Mount Fuji.</p><p>But boosting internet access also makes us vulnerable. This will certainly be a concern in 2020, when millions of locals and thousands of athletes and spectators are using this city’s communications network and infrastructure. This is the fourth time in two years that a delegation of Dutch cyber professionals is visiting Japan. And with good reason.</p><p>The internet has greatly improved our prosperity and wellbeing. In fact, it’s transformed our way of life.Giving us more social contact. Pointing us – literally – in the right direction. And opening up new forms of trade and ways to save energy.</p><p>But it’s also brought new forms of dependency and new security risks. Vital sectors like our infrastructure, communications and banks depend on having a functioning network. Both the Netherlands and Japan have witnessed this first hand, with cyber attacks on their government and businesses. Attacks that could potentially bring our entire society to a halt. And fuel cyber crime and terrorism. So I’m not exaggerating when I say we face a serious cyber security challenge.</p><p>But although it’s a cause for concern, it also presents new opportunities. For collaboration between Japan and the Netherlands, for example. When it comes to the internet and cyberspace, the Netherlands is a frontrunner in Europe, if not the world. Our country is Europe’s number-one internet hub, with the fastest connections. We also have a highly skilled ICT workforce and a flourishing creative industry. So cyber security is serious business for my government.</p><p>That’s why this year the Netherlands hosted the Global Conference on CyberSpace, in the city of The Hague. There, leaders from all over the world confirmed that the cyber security challenge is a global challenge.</p><p>And that we all need to work together – businesses, universities and governments – to make sure the internet remains free, open and secure. So it’s good that the leading players in the Japanese and Dutch ICT sectors are here today to help shape that cross-border cooperation. There have already been successes.</p><p>Like the Japanese Control System Security Center and the Hague-based European Network for Cyber Security, working with private industry to make critical infrastructure cyber secure. Earlier I spoke to the CEOs of Dutch start-up RedSocks and the Japanese Networld Corporation. RedSocks has developed Malware Threat Defender technology that protects companies against the cyber threats of today and tomorrow.</p><p>An attractive concept here in Japan.Which is why Networld has teamed up with RedSocks to distribute this solution.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, we need more partnerships like these. Together we can keep the internet safe. And protect our prosperity, our privacy and our quality of life.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
27,"<p>Today we are welcoming a large Palestinian delegation, led by President Abbas and Prime Minister Hamdallah, to the second Dutch-Palestinian Cooperation Forum. Since the first forum in 2013, the Netherlands has become one of the main European export markets for Palestinian products.</p><p>Prime Minister Hamdallah and I will shortly open the second forum. Where Dutch and Palestinian business leaders and representatives of academic and government institutions will discuss how to further expand our ties.</p><p>During the first forum in 2013 everyone had a sense of hope because of the new impulse to the peace process. Today this has changed into worries, mainly caused by the recent escalation in violence in and around Jerusalem, on the West Bank and in Israel. We regret the victims among Palestinian and Israeli civilians. The Netherlands condemns violence against innocent civilians.</p><p>It’s absolutely vital for both sides to take steps to de-escalate the situation and break the spiral of violence. For example by publicly calling on people to refrain from violence. And to respond to demonstrations and attacks within the limits of the law. So I welcome the agreements made between the Palestinians, Israel and Jordan, with US mediation, aimed at de-escalation and maintaining the status quo at the Temple Mount / Haram al-Sharif. President Abbas has assured me that security cooperation will continue. De-escalation will create a favourable climate for fresh talks on a lasting solution. A political horizon is essential in this regard.</p><p>The Netherlands is committed to a two-state solution, based on the borders of 1967, in which a sovereign Palestinian state exists side by side with Israel in peace and security. We have always stated that Israel must stop expanding its settlements. Settlements are illegal and present a major obstacle to the resumption of negotiations and the two-state solution.</p><p>The Netherlands firmly supports the EU’s efforts to give fresh momentum to the peace process and is providing concrete help to improve the situation on the ground.</p><p>We will continue playing a constructive role. Thanks to our ties with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, for example in forums like today's.</p><p>The situation is difficult, also for businesses that want to trade with the Palestinian Territories. But it’s important to keep investing in development and mutual ties, precisely to promote peace and security.</p>",0
28,"<p>Prime Minister Hamdallah, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>My speech at the first cooperation forum in Bethlehem in 2013 began with the words: anna mabsoet inni hòhn, I’m happy to be here. Today I’d like to begin with: ahlan wa sahlan fi hulanda, welcome to the Netherlands. Because two years on, we are meeting again, this time in The Hague.</p><p>The previous forum was held at a time when Palestinians and Israelis were engaged in negotiations on the peace process. Nobody thought it would be easy, but everybody hoped it would be successful.</p><p>Today we meet in different circumstances, with the unrest in Jerusalem and throughout the West Bank on everyone’s mind. A lot has happened. We have all been shaken in recent weeks by the new wave of violence and demonstrations, which has caused many victims on both sides. A return to violence is not in anyone’s interest, and can never lead to a solution to the conflict. It shows all the more how important a political settlement is, which should lead to a Palestinian state living in peace and security alongside Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders. Right now the parties need to work towards a climate in which negotiations will become possible once more. And work needs to be done to build the Palestinian institutions and economy, so that people can shape their own future.</p><p>This underlines the importance of our meeting one another here today, with business people and researchers as the main participants. It shows that your resilience, resolve and optimism are as strong as ever. That you are committed to overcoming all obstacles to build a better future for yourselves and future generations. At a time when your region is in turmoil and radicalism is rife, moderate forces like ourselves must stand together and press for an innovative, transformative approach. That will increase the chance of peacefully resolving the problems facing the Palestinians.</p><p>The forum in 2013 was a success for several reasons. It was the first time the Netherlands had sent such a large business delegation to the Palestinian Territories – with over 60 representatives of the private sector and academia. Bringing together so many creative Dutch and Palestinian minds led to all kinds of initiatives. Over the past two years, for example, Dutch and Palestinian universities have conducted joint research into non-conventional water resources. And the Association of Netherlands Municipalities has stepped up its cooperation with Rawabi in areas like digitisation and ICT.</p><p>Our economic ties were given fresh impetus too. In 2014, Dutch exports to the Palestinian Territories shot up by 123 per cent, while imports rose by 53 per cent.</p><p>Those may be only numbers, but numbers like these have an impact on people’s lives. Economic progress directly affects living standards, education and health services, and therefore people’s future prospects. In Gaza, for example, the Al Awda factory has ordered new machinery in Lelystad for its cookie production. And Gaza farmers have exported fresh herbs to the Netherlands. So the commercial creativity of the Palestinians and Dutch can flourish even in very difficult circumstances. That is vital, because – as I said in 2013 – the Dutch government firmly believes that prosperity, peace and security all feed into one another. </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that today’s meeting will again lead to many interesting contacts and economic successes. I wish you all an exciting and inspiring day.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",4
29,"<p>Your Majesty, Mesdames Presidents of the Houses of Parliament, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, and of course – and I say these words with some trepidation – members of the States General,</p><p>Let me begin with the most important thing: on behalf of the government, I would like to congratulate the House of Representatives and the Senate on their two hundredth anniversary. It’s an anniversary that deserves to be celebrated. The Binnenhof can be a noisy and adversarial place. Nevertheless, we have a parliamentary democracy to be proud of. And cherish. Because if events like the MH17 disaster and the Syrian refugee crisis highlight one thing, it’s that democracy, freedom and the rule of law are the mainstay of a country’s strength. </p><p>We have just seen how, in the space of 200 years, the Netherlands has developed a health and welfare system that is virtually without equal. That is one of our parliamentary democracy’s collective successes. It is associated with the names of Liberals like Samuel van Houten, Social-Democrats like Willem Drees and Christian-Democrats like Marga Klompé, who – according to tradition – was called Our Lady of Perpetual Help by her colleague Joseph Luns. Although she introduced the Social Assistance Act, she never claimed benefits herself. ‘Father’ Drees, who introduced the Old Age Pensions Act, did, however, enjoy his old age pension for many years, as he lived to the age of 101. A pension well deserved. And as a sensible, thrifty social-democrat, he wisely foresaw that the retirement age would have to increase in line with life expectancy.</p><p>All our achievements over the last 200 years can in fact be ascribed to our collective endeavour, rather than to any one party or movement. In the Netherlands, legislation is always supported by several parties. In retrospect, that may well be our parliamentary system’s greatest strength: our focus on cooperation, and on seeking common ground, which in the end we nearly always find. The spirit of sensible compromise is never far away, and this has certainly done us no harm.</p><p>We live in one of the most prosperous countries in the world. That is something we have accomplished together. But we cannot take our prosperity for granted. Laws, rules and social provisions require maintenance. They need to be constantly adapted to the changing needs of the people and to the changing requirements of the time. Only then can we preserve our country’s great achievements.</p><p>In this way continuity and change always go hand in hand. That was also true 200 years ago, when the bicameral parliamentary system was laid down in the 1815 Constitution. The new parliament was named the States General, a familiar term dating from the time of the Dutch Republic, but with the Binnenhof as its meeting place.</p><p>If the parliamentarians of 1815 could have seen what the Netherlands looks today, they would not have believed their eyes. Spatially, socially, politically, technologically, economically – everything is completely different now. And whatever the next 200 years may bring, the process of change will continue unabated. Instead of fearing the future, let us continue working together to keep our constitutional democracy, our economy and our society strong and up-to-date.</p><p>I believe there is every reason to have confidence in the future. Our economy ranks fifth worldwide on the Global Competitiveness Index. Our institutions are robust. Our people have a strong sense of solidarity. And our parliamentary democracy has brought us far, and will bring us even further.</p><p>It is precisely at a time like the present, when many people feel uncertain and divisions seem to be widening, that our parliamentary democracy must demonstrate its unifying force. That was also the call that King Willem I made in his speech from the throne exactly 200 years ago, on 16 October 1815. He urged the members of the States General, who at that time were still ‘mighty noble lords’, to work together to protect the national interest and to remain steadfastly calm.</p><p>Since then, our system has more than proved its worth. For two hundred years the States General have served the general interest. And on this special occasion, there is only one wish that I would like to express to you and the Dutch public: ‘Long live the States General.’</p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
30,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p> Thank you for your warm welcome. It's a pleasure to be here at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. A fitting place to talk about a crucial issue. </p><p> Today, I'd like to tell you about two young Dutchmen who went to San Francisco to study in 2011. There, they created the 'Hack 100'. A list of 100 high-tech businesses whose websites they checked for security vulnerabilities. They reported any problems directly to the companies, one of which was Facebook. Alex Rice, Head of Product Security, was impressed and decided to invest in the project. This led to the creation of HackerOne. The company has now located and resolved more than 12,000 security vulnerabilities on the websites of major players like Yahoo, Airbnb and Twitter. Making the internet safer as a result. It's a fantastic example of Dutch-US cooperation. One of those young Dutchmen, Michiel Prins, is taking part in this trade mission, together with some of his colleagues. </p><p> Every day these people deal with the focus of this seminar: the impact of emerging technologies on financial services and cyber security. It's about more than one flaw on one site. The internet shapes our daily lives. Everything from our social contacts to our security and infrastructure. It has given us a lot. Like access to information anywhere in the world. And new, smart ways of doing business that increase economic growth and employment. But it has also brought risks. </p><p> We must remember that everything - including vital sectors like energy, telecommunications, banking and security - is linked to the internet. So society can't function without network availability. And that makes it vulnerable. Disrupt the system and you disrupt society itself.</p><p>The internet also offers criminals opportunities to 'go global'. We've all heard media reports about cyber crime and its consequences. More and more companies and financial institutions are the target of sophisticated cyber attacks. Causing serious economic damage. That's why tackling cyber crime - or, better yet, promoting cyber security - is vital if we want to safeguard the internet.</p><p>International cooperation between governments and the private sector is an essential part of this.The internet transcends national borders. Countries must share information and fight cyber crime together.</p><p>In the Netherlands, public-private cooperation is a big priority. A successful example of this approach is the Dutch Information Sharing and Analysis Centre which tackles cyber attacks on the financial sector. And it's working: in 2014 the damage caused by payment traffic fraud in the Netherlands was half that in 2013. </p><p> Cyber crime is a problem for major multinationals and institutions too. And it's often startups that can offer the quick and flexible solutions needed. That's why, in the Netherlands, we're seeing more and more big businesses and banks joining forces with startups.</p><p>I don't think it's a coincidence that two young Dutchmen helped found HackerOne. The Netherlands and Flanders are world-leaders when it comes to creating and using innovative digital technologies. Our payment systems are some of the most advanced in the world. So is our IT infrastructure. It's no accident that the Netherlands is home to the world's second-largest internet exchange point. For several years now, our region has been home to a booming cyber-security and FinTech startup scene.</p><p>At the same time, Atlanta is gaining a reputation as the Silicon Valley of FinTech and cyber security. Hence the nickname 'Transaction Alley'. And institutions like world-renowned Georgia Tech are providing the knowledge to make this happen.</p><p>It's vital that we bring together expertise from the Netherlands, Flanders and Atlanta.</p><p>The Dutch-Flemish region is a digital information and logistics hub. Atlanta is the FinTech and cyber-security centre of the world. All have large, tech-savvy workforces with lots to offer each other. And that could lead to new innovations, economic growth and jobs. But it goes deeper than that. It's about enhancing our safety and security. It's about reducing terrorist threats. It's about privacy and quality of life. That's what makes today's discussion so crucial.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
31,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Think of Atlanta and you think of Coca-Cola. Think of the Netherlands and you think of Heineken. Both are great export products and are among the most famous brand names in the world. I must admit that one is a bit more famous than the other. But I think we can agree that we both know about beverages!</p><p>I mention these companies for a reason. They are excellent examples of the growing cooperation between the Dutch-Flemish region and Atlanta. Heineken has a distribution centre here in the Port of Savannah. And Coca-Cola Enterprises just expanded its operations in the Netherlands by opening one of Europe's most advanced production sites in Dongen.</p><p>But beverages are not the only thing we have in common. We are on different continents, with an ocean between us. We might seem to be worlds apart, but we are not. And the American entrepreneurs here today know that better than anyone. We very much appreciate your investment in the Netherlands and your selecting the Netherlands-Flanders business delta to create a foothold in Europa.</p><p>The Dutch and Flemish businesses on this trade mission are equally interested in technology matchmaking and doing business in the US. That's because business is in our DNA and has been for centuries. We've always looked beyond our borders. </p><p> And today - to paraphrase Ray Charles - we've got Georgia on our mind.</p><p>In fact, we've got each other on our minds, and that's why the economic ties between the Netherlands, Flanders and Atlanta are growing. The value of exports from Georgia to the Netherlands is 850 million dollars a year. And exports in the other direction are worth 900 million dollars a year. That's a total export value of nearly two billion dollars.</p><p>It makes sense that ties between our regions are growing closer. Just as Georgia is a gateway to the US, the Netherlands and Flanders are the gateway to Europe. </p><p> You have the great port of Savannah; we have the great ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp. These are crucial logistics hubs in the US and Europe.</p><p>But our regions are also leaders in information technology. And in this field, the sky's the limit. I recently heard someone say that digital development is the circulatory system of the new economy. There's a great need for smart ideas and innovations. </p><p> In the Netherlands and Flanders, we know that. And in Atlanta, you know it better than anyone. Your city has been called the new Silicon Valley of FinTech and cyber security.</p><p>Amsterdam has also proven to be fertile ground for startups. Take the software company Backbase, a member of our trade delegation. Backbase creates smart customer interactions for mobile apps, and has long outgrown its startup status. This week they are opening an office in Atlanta.</p><p>And that's only one of many examples. Startups are springing up all over the Netherlands, not only in Amsterdam. This is thanks to our innovative mind-set and enterprising spirit. The Netherlands is home to leading technology clusters, with world-class R&D in the fields of agrifood, life sciences and health, chemicals and high-tech. In these clusters, business, academia and government work together in a truly unique way, creating a climate for innovation. And we have an educated and flexible workforce with an open, international and pro-business mentality.</p><p>But you've already noticed that. Many of you have been active in the Netherlands for many years and you continue to grow your business and expand your operations. </p><p> This past year, we've seen new companies from Georgia starting operations in the Netherlands, like Inmark, Kids II, Speakeasy and Spanx. And Dutch companies like KLM and BCD are opening locations in Georgia.</p><p>That's exciting. And the innovative power of the Netherlands, Flanders and Georgia offers many more opportunities in FinTech, information security and logistics. </p><p> That's why I'm happy you're all here today. My colleagues from the NFIA and I will listen carefully to your needs. We want to know what you need to keep your business booming in Europe, so that we can provide a pro-business investment climate and maintain our leading position. In the words of the legendary Yogi Berra - may he rest in peace: 'when you arrive at a fork in the road, take it'. Well, we plan to take it.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",2
32,"<p>Mayor Reed, Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p> It’s a pleasure and an honour to be at this fantastic venue this evening. </p><p> I studied history at university. So a dinner at the Atlanta History Center really appealed to me. This impressive building radiates a love of history and respect for the past. </p><p> The Atlanta History Center has plenty of stories to tell. This city and region have a rich and varied history. You can see that from the many exhibitions in this building. </p><p> They cover everything from the American Civil War and the film classic Gone with the Wind, to the 1996 Olympic Games. </p><p> And I saw it for myself yesterday, when I visited the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site. The story of Dr King’s fight for freedom and justice is still an inspiration to us all. Freedom and justice are values we promote worldwide. They bind our countries together. They form the basis of our friendship and our political, military and economic partnerships. </p><p> The Dutch, Americans and Flemish have a no-nonsense approach to doing business. </p><p> Our focus is on solutions, not problems. This shared mentality has created excellent trade ties, which are more than four centuries old. And we’re still going strong. What’s more, there are lots of new opportunities. That’s why we’re working to make trade between Europe and the US easier, with the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. </p><p> Trade and investment between my country and the US have created almost 24,000 jobs in Georgia and the Netherlands. For years the Netherlands has been among the top five foreign investors in the US. And the US, for its part, is the biggest foreign direct investor in the Netherlands. </p><p> But there’s always room for improvement. And that’s why Minister President Bourgeois and I are here today. We have brought along a delegation of Dutch and Flemish IT and logistics companies. And they are all very interested in exploring business and technology matchmaking opportunities. </p><p> The reason for Flanders and the Netherlands joining forces on this trade mission is obvious. Not only do we share a language, culture and history: the Dutch-Flemish delta region is considered the ‘gateway to Europe’. This is thanks to the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport and the region’s excellent roads and waterways. And we have a counterpart in Georgia. Atlanta’s international airport is a major hub for domestic air traffic, and more than 12,300 logistics companies have branches in the region. Georgia is one of America’s fastest-growing states in terms of its economy and population. And Atlanta is its beating heart. </p><p> But there’s more. One of the most famous products to emerge from this city is Coca Cola. For years, pharmacist John Pemberton sold a popular alcoholic drink. When prohibition came into force in Atlanta in 1885, he replaced the wine in his drink with sugar syrup. It’s a story which really speaks to me. Because it shows the power of inventiveness and flexibility. Pemberton didn’t see an obstacle in prohibition. He saw an opportunity. And then created the most famous soft drink in the world. </p><p> This was more than a century ago. But Pemberton’s innovative spirit lives on. </p><p> Atlanta is gaining a reputation around the world as the Silicon Valley of financial technologies and information security. More than 70 per cent of all online payments in the US go through Georgia’s ‘Transaction Alley’. </p><p> Innovative FinTech and cyber-security startups are also sprouting up across the Netherlands and Flanders. In fact, Amsterdam is quickly becoming one of the FinTech capitals of the world. Just look at companies like Backbase and Parkmobile: high-tech businesses leading the global digital applications sector. </p><p> Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p> With all this exciting potential, maybe we should ask ourselves why we didn’t visit sooner. The innovative power of the Netherlands, Flanders and Georgia offers exciting opportunities in financial technologies, information security and logistics. </p><p> I’m looking forward to a fascinating evening. Please take the opportunity to get to know each other, hatch some plans and make a few deals that will benefit us all. </p><p> Thank you.</p>",2
33,"<p>Governor, </p><p> First Lady of Georgia, </p><p> Brigadier General, </p><p> Commissioner, </p><p> Your Excellencies, </p><p> ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Seventy years ago, Europe and the Netherlands were liberated by brave, young Americans. Seventy years ago, those courageous soldiers put their lives on the line for peace and security on the other side of the world. Seventy years ago, far too many of them died a long way from home.</p><p>This May on Memorial Day I was at the American cemetery in Margraten, a solemn and moving place in the hills of the southern Netherlands. Today, more than 8,000 white marble crosses bear silent witness to the sacrifices that were made. </p><p> People still in the flush of youth, like Private First Class Robert Long of Worth County, Georgia. These sons and daughters answered the call to fight for a country they didn’t know and for people they’d never met. They left their homes, families and loved ones behind. Families who waited in vain for them to return.  </p><p>As always, that visit made a deep impression on me. In 2005 the entire Dutch government attended the memorial with President Bush. And this year too, there were veterans and surviving relatives there whose advanced age may prevent them from visiting the graves of their loved ones again. But as I said to them: the people of Europe will never forget them. We will keep saying their names and telling their stories.</p><p>All the graves at Margraten have been adopted by people who live close by. </p><p> By families and school classes. There’s even a waiting list. Year in and year out, these people tend the graves. They write to the families of the fallen, and arrange visits back and forth. And they do it out of respect and gratitude to our liberators.</p><p>It is an honour to pay my respects to them on American soil today. The Netherlands will be forever grateful for the sacrifices that Americans made to secure our freedom. Today, we remember the fallen and honour the men and women willing to give their lives to make the world a safer place - in the past, and today. Men and women like Airman 1st Class Kcey Ruiz from Georgia, who was killed in a plane crash in Afghanistan, only this Friday. Our thoughts are with her family.</p><p>The courage of these heroes still inspires us today. It inspires us to keep working for peace and security worldwide. Just as the United States and the Netherlands have fought shoulder to shoulder in Korea, Afghanistan and in the battle against ISIS.</p><p>Our joint efforts symbolise the age-old friendship between our two countries. A friendship based on shared values. On our deep-rooted faith in democracy, freedom, justice and human rights.</p><p>Seventy years later, freedom is still not a given for everyone. Thousands of refugees are knocking on Europe’s door because they fear for their lives in their own country. </p><p> We have a duty to our liberators to keep working for peace worldwide. Together we must work to achieve the liberty that General Eisenhower called for.</p><p>On the eve of D-Day, the general encouraged the troops with his Order of the Day. </p><p> He said, ‘The free men of the world are marching together to victory. I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and skill in battle.’</p><p>The courage, devotion and skill of those free men still resonate 70 years later, in the hills of the southern Netherlands and here today. Thanks to them we stand here in freedom.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
34,"<p>Mr President, esteemed colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>On 8 January this year I stood among thousands of people on Dam Square in Amsterdam. It was one day after the cowardly attack in Paris on the editorial staff of Charlie Hebdo.</p><p>One day after the cold-blooded murder of twelve innocent people. People around the world were deeply affected by these events. ‘Je suis Charlie’.</p><p>We said it in Amsterdam too. It was an evening I’ll never forget. There we stood, united and resolute. Men and women from all corners of the earth, young and old, people of every religious background.</p><p>And our message to terrorists was loud and clear. We are different and yet we are one. We are the majority. And we will not let you divide us. ‘Hands off our freedom’, were my words that night.</p><p>And I can still feel the emotion of that moment. Da’esh and violent extremism are not other people’s problems.</p><p>Not only are countries like Syria and Iraq being completely destabilised, this threat also spreads insecurity and fuels tensions in our own communities. That is why the Netherlands is and will remain so actively involved in the fight against Da’esh and in combating violent extremism.</p><p>We have an obligation to help foster international peace and stability. And we cannot take our own freedom for granted. So we stand shoulder to shoulder with many other countries, in the region and beyond, in the coalition against Da’esh.</p><p>Dutch F-16s are involved in the air campaign against Da’esh targets on a daily basis. We have sent military trainers and equipment to Iraq to train the Iraqi army and the Peshmerga. We are also providing emergency aid, implementing counter-messaging strategies and working on capacity building. It’s not an easy task, but it is crucial. When people are being beheaded and ancient heritage sites are being destroyed with sledgehammers, we must respond. And we must respond there where it is happening.</p><p>A second track the Netherlands is following is prevention. In our own country we’ve developed a broad programme, focusing not only on potential foreign terrorist fighters, but on parents, schools, local government and the local police too. If we can give young – often impressionable – people the prospect of a good future, they will be less drawn to extremist groups.</p><p>The idea is that intervening early in their immediate social environment is the best way to stop young people being tempted to go off to fight abroad. Any kind of positive and moderate influence can help. Our approach is inclusive where possible, but repressive where necessary.</p><p>Our international efforts include working with partners in the Global Counterterrorism Forum. The Forum is the primary platform where countries can share knowledge and information in order to prevent terrorism. A few days ago the Netherlands became co-chair of the Forum, affirming our long-term commitment. The Forum complements and collaborates with the UN and other organisations.</p><p>Over the past year there’s been a big focus on how to prevent potential foreign terrorist fighters from travelling abroad. And how to deal with those who come back.</p><p>The fact is that violent extremism and terrorist groups like Da’esh, Al-Qa’ida, Jabhat al Nusra and Boko Haram are constantly evolving. This is not a static threat, and it will not simply disappear. The international community cannot afford to sit back. We must be vigilant and persistent. We must continue to make it clear that we are not fighting a religion. We are fighting terrorists who carry out attacks and whose barbarism knows no bounds.</p><p>For that reason too, it’s good that we’re meeting here today. The Netherlands remains fully committed to the task ahead. Freedom is our inspiration. Resolve is our weapon. And together we will succeed in pushing back the terrorist threat.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
35,"<p>Speech by Prime Minister Mark Rutte at the Summit on Peacekeeping Operations, 28 September 2015</p><p>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>President Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, 'When peace has been broken anywhere, the peace of all countries everywhere is in danger'. These words capture the spirit of today's summit. </p><p>We're here to renew our commitment to the UN's aim of promoting peace and security worldwide. I'd like to thank President Obama and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for this important initiative. We face big challenges and we have high expectations of UN peace missions. So we must make sure we keep supplying the UN with enough people and resources. After all, we are the UN.</p><p>The past few years have brought war and conflict very close to home. The violence, the enormous refugee flows: we cannot ignore what is happening.</p><p>The Kingdom of the Netherlands has a long-standing tradition of active involvement in international affairs. That commitment explains our candidacy for a seat on the UN Security Council in 2017 and 2018. Since 1947 our country has been involved in more than sixty UN-mandated missions in over thirty countries, deploying more than 125,000 men and women. The belief underlying our contributions to these missions has always been that in many conflict situations, it is only the UN that can legitimately intervene. </p><p>That belief also prompted us to host a European prelude to this summit in Amsterdam last February. More than forty countries attended and reaffirmed their support for UN peace missions and how to make these missions more effective. The Netherlands believes the basis should be a clear mandate and an integrated approach. Regional partnerships and better cooperation with local communities are essential.</p><p>The Netherlands will remain fully committed to peacekeeping in the years ahead. </p><p>Let me be specific:</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, the importance of UN peace missions is beyond question. One conflict, in one country or one continent, affects us all. But to stay effective, we must keep working, keep innovating and keep focusing. </p><p>The Netherlands stands ready to play its part.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
36,"<p>Esteemed colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Sigrid Kaag is the senior Dutch diplomat at the United Nations. She led the mission to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons and is currently a UN envoy in Lebanon. Next to her office door is a sign saying: ‘men to the left, because women are always right’. I won’t comment on whether she’s right about that.</p><p>But it’s true that all too often, conference rooms and offices like Sigrid Kaag’s are occupied by men. And around the world, far too many women aren’t free to make their own decisions about work, attending school, who they marry or even what clothes to wear.</p><p>Twenty years ago ministers from all over the world came together in Beijing to talk about this issue. Since then, some progress has been made, but the ultimate goal – equal rights and opportunities for men and women – is still a long way off.</p><p>That’s why it’s so important that we’re here today. Because in leaving the potential of women and girls untapped, we are missing out on opportunities for development, justice and peace.</p><p>That’s why the Netherlands remains committed to this agenda – both at home and internationally. Worldwide, women’s participation in the work force has been stuck at fifty-five per cent for two decades.</p><p>By comparison, the figure for men is currently eighty per cent. Not only is this a gross injustice to women and their families, it’s also an expensive loss to companies, governments and the world economy. We have to do better.</p><p>Today we’re here to tell each other what we’re doing to change this and what the current situation is in our own countries. When it comes to gender equality, the Netherlands ranks among the top 10 in the UN index for 2015. More women than men follow higher education in the Netherlands. And they’re getting better results. That’s good news.</p><p>But we can’t afford to rest on our laurels. Because the fact remains that women in our country still earn sixteen per cent less than men for the same work. Seventy-seven per cent of women in the Netherlands work part-time. So many women aren’t economically independent.</p><p>The Dutch government is therefore committed to increasing women’s economic independence and financial self-sufficiency, especially the low-skilled and functionally illiterate. To this end, we’re working with local authorities, businesses and educational institutes to offer opportunities like job interview training.</p><p>Equality between women and men is also a guiding principle of our foreign policy and development efforts. Because we know that gender equality provides a basis for stability and economic prosperity. We work closely with governments, businesses and civil society organisations around the world to achieve this goal.</p><p>We also work with human rights defenders standing up for equal rights for women. We help protect their freedom of speech, assembly and association so they can advance this cause.</p><p>In January 2016, my government is launching a programme called Funding Leadership and Opportunities for Women. Its aim is to support women’s economic and political participation and combat violence against women and girls in low-income and low middle-income countries. It will be the largest fund of its kind in the world. An important part of our international efforts is advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights.</p><p>For women worldwide to have a voice and economic opportunities, they need to be able to make their own choices about sexuality and family planning. So in 2016 the Netherlands is launching another major fund to advance these rights around the world.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, we can’t afford to waste the potential of half the world’s population. I don’t know if women are always right, but they should at least have the same opportunities as men to prove it.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",6
37,"<p>Mr Secretary-General, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>One of your illustrious predecessors, Mr Secretary-General, once said, ‘Never look down to test the ground before taking your next step; only he who keeps his eye fixed on the far horizon will find the right road.’</p><p>These wise words by Dag Hammarskjöld have never been more fitting than they are today. Fifteen years ago, the international community fixed its gaze on the horizon.</p><p>The Millennium Development Goals showed an unprecedented level of ambition. At the time, many wondered whether we needed a reality check.Were the goals really achievable?</p><p>We now know the answer to that question. The MDGs have been a big success, even though there are major regional differences and not every goal was reached precisely as intended.</p><p>So what has the world achieved in the past fifteen years? Well, among other things:</p><p>Of course, there is still a lot to be done.</p><p>But here, on the eve of the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda and the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals for 2016 to 2030, the success of the MDGs should give us confidence in the next leap forward.</p><p>The MDGs have taught us many lessons over the past fifteen years. Today I would like to mention three. Three lessons we should take to heart as we move ahead with the SDGs.</p><p>First: by working together, in a collective effort, we can make a difference. We can achieve great things if we set our minds, our means and our hearts to it. </p><p>Second: goals like eradicating poverty, achieving gender equality and giving the poor better health care and sanitation should go hand in hand with multi-stakeholder involvement, sound economic principles and sustainable development. There really is no substitute for an integrated approach.</p><p>And third: we must have more private sector involvement in long-term financing, in public-private partnerships and in projects on the ground. Dutch companies and the Dutch government already have a solid track record.</p><p>Last year, more than sixty partners signed the Post-2015 Charter, a corporate initiative that brings together Dutch businesses, universities and other organisations that have already committed to the agenda we’re discussing at this summit.</p><p>So on behalf of the Netherlands, I applaud the outcome of the recent Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa.New and innovative partnerships and financing arrangements will be key factors for success in the fifteen years of hard work that lie ahead of us.</p><p>So what does private sector involvement look like in practice? It could look like the ambition Heineken has formulated for its breweries in Africa and the Middle East, to source sixty per cent of all its ingredients locally.</p><p>The Netherlands is supporting this effort by offering training for farmers. And it’s working. In Burundi, for example, this partnership has already enabled 18,000 farmers to make a steady income by supplying this world-famous Dutch brewer.</p><p>It could also look like the Health Insurance Fund, a public-private initiative supported by some of the largest Dutch insurance companies. In 2014 alone, the fund provided health and agricultural insurance for 460,000 people in sub-Saharan countries. Sixty per cent of them were women.</p><p>But it could also look like the Amsterdam Initiative against Malnutrition, or AIM, which was launched in 2009. AIM brings together many partners: the Dutch government and NGOs, multinationals in food and chemicals like Unilever, DSM and AkzoNobel, and agricultural knowledge institutions like Wageningen University and Research Centre.</p><p>AIM’s focus is on making good-quality and nutritious food available to as many vulnerable people as possible, using a market-based approach. The bottom line is simple: developed and run by 20 African and Dutch partners, AIM’s project portfolio now provides 26 million people with better access to nutritious foods. The market-based approach is an important driver behind AIM, and I believe it sets an example for the future.</p><p>Within the framework of the SDGs and corporate social responsibility, many individual firms are expressing a growing desire for more effective public-private partnerships. More and more SMEs are eager to follow in the sustainable footsteps of multinationals that have led the way. They believe the ‘S ’in SDG offers opportunities for investment and innovation. It’s up to governments and the UN to facilitate, stimulate and make sure that the legal and economic frameworks are in good working order.</p><p>And I’m confident that if we do this and keep on working together, we can unleash far more trade and investment in poor countries, moving the needle further from ‘charitable’ to ‘profitable’ in the years ahead.</p><p>Our commitment to jointly promoting development, in the framework of the UN, is one of the main reasons why the Kingdom of the Netherlands is seeking a seat on the UN Security Council for the 2017 to 2018 term.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Netherlands is fully committed to making the next leap forward.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",2
38,"<p>A year has passed. </p><p> Only a year. </p><p> Or should that be: has it been a year already?</p><p>No doubt, for many of you, there is some truth in both feelings. </p><p> Time stood still on 17 July 2014. </p><p> But the days, weeks and months since then have raced by in a blur, because of all that has happened. </p><p> The personal loss, the grief and the absence – this pain will only ease gradually and is unlikely ever to fade entirely. </p><p> It has been a year of private mourning with family and close friends, while a media storm raged outside, with its clamour of news, pictures and stories. </p><p> ‘My sister has become a news item,’ as someone put it. </p><p> There was the tension of the identification process and all the arrangements to be dealt with. </p><p> But there was also comfort and consolation from people who held you to their hearts, in a country that continues to feel your loss intensely.</p><p>You were confronted with all these feelings at the same time. </p><p> And you still are. </p><p> They are all bound up together. </p><p> And everyone experiences this whirlwind of emotions in their own way. </p><p> It’s good to have the space to do so. </p><p> And it’s important that you continue to have that space. </p><p> Because the 298 unique people we remember today will always be connected with your lives and those of thousands of others. </p><p> Lives that go on, but with ‘a gaping hole’, as one of the next of kin described it recently.</p><p>Today is a difficult day – a day of reliving events. </p><p> It is inevitable that everything will come flooding back. </p><p> How and where you heard the news: a moment frozen in time. </p><p> The painful realisation that, from an unknown location thousands of kilometres away, death had entered your home. </p><p> The disbelief, the oppressive feeling of powerlessness, and the tears. </p><p> It is all still so immediate.</p><p>At the same time, this is a day for sharing memories. </p><p> A time to pause and reflect on all the good things that the victims of MH17 bequeathed. </p><p> Hopefully this will make it a day of comfort and hope, which will help sustain you in your daily lives.</p><p>Let me also just say this. </p><p> In addition to the pain you were already feeling, I realise that incredible demands have also been placed on your patience and trust over the past year. </p><p> This only serves to increase my respect for the dignity you have shown. </p><p> I would like to express to you my heartfelt gratitude. </p><p> Because after the grief and the intense sense of loss, the long and complex aftermath is one of the most difficult things to cope with: the recovery of the remains and the wreckage, the investigation into what exactly happened, and everything that still needs to be done in order to do right by your loved ones. </p><p> And yet that is what everyone wants, and tens if not hundreds of people are working every day with heart and soul to achieve this. </p><p> And they will continue to do so.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, the first, difficult year has passed. </p><p> And however you experience this moment, one thing is certain: the victims of MH17, your loved ones, will never be forgotten. </p><p> I hope that this remembrance will be a source of hope and strength for you.</p>",0
39,"<p>Mr Chief Minister, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>It’s a great pleasure to be here this evening, on my first official trip to India, and my first visit to Mumbai. It’s good to see so many of you here, in the country’s economic capital. With me is the biggest Dutch trade delegation to visit India in recent times. I’m joined by representatives of eighty Dutch businesses, both large and small. They’re led by Hans de Boer, chairman of the largest employers’ association in the Netherlands.</p><p>By ‘recent times’ I mean the last couple of decades. Because back in the early seventeenth century, many such delegations came to India from the Dutch Republic. In fact, some were even bigger than this one.</p><p>Back then Dutch ships roamed the world’s oceans looking for trade. One of their ports of call was in India, where over time they set up a dozen trading posts. In some places, like Madras, those trading stations were active for nearly two centuries. Many traces of that common cultural heritage still remain today.</p><p>Going back only one century, many modern Dutch firms set up operations here. They’ve done so well and become so integrated that many locals don’t even know that Philips and Unilever have Dutch roots. They’re seen as Indian companies. </p><p>That’s a good example of how flexible and pragmatic Dutch companies are. They can adjust to local circumstances without risking their core values and skills. And they often show great foresight. Long before Prime Minister Modi called on global investors to ‘Make in India’, Dutch firms were operating here. Unilever soaps were first produced in Mumbai in 1934, and the first Philips lightbulbs in Kolkata in 1938.</p><p>So ‘Make in India’ is close to our hearts. It played a big role in the discussions I had yesterday in Delhi with Prime Minister Modi and with CEOs of leading Indian and Dutch companies.</p><p>Dutch companies are keen to invest more in India. They’re also excited about the Modi government’s reform programme, with its ambitious goals to transform and modernise the Indian economy.</p><p>I told the Prime Minister that the Netherlands is eager to help achieve these goals. We can partner India in a wide range of areas. From helping clean up rivers to setting up agricultural centres of excellence. And offering water management expertise, for example to the state of Maharashtra.</p><p>We have great expertise in these fields. Dutch firms work on projects like this all round the world. Like advising the US government after hurricane Katrina and helping the city of New York improve its flood protection. And expanding Hong Kong Airport into the sea, creating islands off the coast of Dubai and protecting the city of Jakarta from rising water levels.</p><p>We hope to extend this kind of partnership with India, as well. We have a good foundation – our bilateral economic relations are already strong and wide-ranging. We are major trading partners. Both India and the Netherlands are among the top five foreign investors in each other’s country, and our mutual trade amounts to almost six billion euros.</p><p>Our business community feels the excitement of a resurgent, fast-growing India, and wants to be part of that bright future. And more and more successful Indian companies are taking to the global stage. They’re finding the Netherlands an excellent launch pad as a European base. In recent years, over 200 Indian companies have set up operations in the Netherlands. My country hosts one of the largest populations of people of Indian origin in Europe – second only to the UK. We hope that many Indian companies will follow. Because they bring not only new investments and new jobs, but also new knowledge, insights and expertise to our country.</p><p>Growing bilateral trade and investment also pay social and cultural dividends. Take the exhibition of beautiful paintings by Lita Cabellut that I opened earlier today. Or the fine initiative we saw this afternoon at the Holland Village, where former Dutch hockey champions are promoting a campaign to restore India to the top of the international hockey rankings. The aim is to recruit a million new young hockey players.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Let me conclude by saying how happy I am to be here at such an exciting time for India. The American writer Mark Twain once said, ‘India is the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend, and the great grandmother of tradition’. India indeed has a rich history, but it also has a very bright future. I’m delighted that the Netherlands can play a part in shaping that future.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
40,"<p>Secretary-General, excellencies, ministers, deputy-ministers,</p><p>Today it is my honour to welcome you all to Paris and, as prime minister of the Netherlands, to chair this annual OECD Ministerial Council Meeting. I'd like to offer a warm welcome to my esteemed colleagues and vice-chairs from the Czech Republic, France and Korea. And let me thank you, Secretary-General Gurría, for your hospital and my congratulations with your third term as Secretary-General of OECD. We often call on people to work beyond 65, but you have taken that very seriously. Under your leadership the OECD plays a vital role in giving governments and businesses the knowledge and statistics they need to develop policies and take decisions that benefit us all.</p><p>The Netherlands first chaired the MCM in 1964, in a bipolar world at the height of the Cold War. It was a time when the global market place was little more than national economies competing with each other. Our second time was in 1991, a few years after Perestroika and the fall of the Berlin Wall. In Europe, the key priority at that time was warp-speed economic integration. But big economies like China and India were slowly entering the world market too. Integration changed the world's production and trade patterns forever. We know that all too well now, after a global crisis that underscored how interconnected the global economy has become. And it is the magnitude of these changes, and all the opportunities and risks they bring, that we are dealing with today.</p><p>As the emerging economies' significance and integration into the world economy grows, so the OECD's importance grows too. After all, in today's world, well-functioning markets and free-flowing international trade and investment determine the prosperity and wellbeing of more and more people.</p><p>The good news is that we are finally recovering from the crisis. And I do hope that the OECD Economic Outlook that is being presented here today will show other encouraging signs of recovery. But to speed things up and pave the way for new growth and new jobs, it's essential to raise investment at all levels. I'm glad this Ministerial Council Meeting is focusing on that problem, because investment was hit hard by the crisis, and its recovery has been sluggish. In advanced economies, investment has declined by 20 per cent, on average, compared with pre-crisis forecasts. That's a serious amount, and it raises serious questions that need serious answers.</p><p>On the positive side, investment conditions are quite favourable. Interest rates are at an all-time low in many countries. Big companies, particularly, are holding large amounts of cash and hesitating to make new investments. The question we face today is: how do we unlock those resources to create new and sustainable economic growth that generates the new jobs we so badly need? We can't just wave a magic wand, but there are several things that government and business can do to help. One is to expand public-private partnerships, which are enjoying more and more success in various countries and have led to more investment across a wide range of sectors. Another one of course is structural reform, which is the trademark of OECD recommendations.</p><p>To fuel the discussion even further, let me highlight two other issues that I believe are key to today's topics.</p><p>First: Investment, whether domestic or foreign, financed privately or publicly, will only pay off in an enabling environment. That means all countries need to pay attention to good governance, the rule of law, legal certainty, anti-corruption measures, a level playing field and a well functioning market, without too much red tape. All these elements help foster a climate in which everyone can confidently participate in the economy: investors at home and abroad, consumers and savers, local companies and foreign enterprises.</p><p>Second, we must have a keen eye for sustainability and innovation as we work to boost investment. Not only because it's a clear necessity, but also because it provides many promising business opportunities. Take climate change and the need for renewable energy. Take demographic ageing, the fast-growing digital economy or the challenge of how to feed nine billion people by 2050. These are just a few examples that illustrate the need for new, innovative and future-proof solutions. Sustainability and responsible business conduct are not simply optional extras anymore - they're a business case we can't ignore.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have a lot of work ahead of us. But it will be worth it. Because at global level this meeting provides an excellent opportunity to have an interactive, fact-based discussion. We need to consider how best to unlock new investment for sustainable growth and jobs. I'm sure that will motivate all of us to make this Ministerial Council Meeting a great success. I wish you many useful discussions and an inspiring conference focussing on investment, investment and investment. </p><p> Thank you.</p>",7
41,"<p>Today we honour the heroes who liberated us seventy years ago, and who made the ultimate sacrifice. </p><p> One of them was Gerald 'Mike' Kight. </p><p> For nearly seventy years his name stood on the Tablets of the Missing. </p><p> Here in Margraten. </p><p> He was reported missing after heavy fighting in the hills around Groesbeek. </p><p> Mike's three brothers returned, but he didn't come home. </p><p> His absence left a gaping hole in the family. </p><p> His mother placed a little flag in the window. </p><p> As a symbol of hope that he would return. </p><p> Hope that lasted for decades, because his story was passed down through the family.</p><p>A few years ago, Mike Kight's remains were found on farmland near Groesbeek. </p><p> His body was surrounded by bullet casings. </p><p> Proof that he went on fighting right to the end. </p><p> A bronze rosette has now been placed next to his name on the Tablets of the Missing, to show that he has been found. </p><p> Mike's ashes were buried with his mother. </p><p> At last they were reunited. </p><p> His journey home - one that took seventy years too long - was finally over.</p><p>The story of Mike Kight is one of the many stories that bring us together today. </p><p> His story is about hope, about heroism and about sacrifices made in the name of freedom. </p><p> Sacrifices almost too great to imagine.</p><p>Eight thousand, three hundred and one American soldiers found their last resting place here. </p><p> One thousand, seven hundred and twenty-two names are recorded on the Tablets of the Missing. </p><p> A rosette has been placed next to seventy-nine of them. </p><p> These numbers are almost impossible to conceive. </p><p> Yet at the same time, these thousands of white crosses make them only too real. </p><p> Their simple beauty is heart-rending. </p><p> Because they represent lives. </p><p> Lives of men, often only in their twenties, who carried the world on their shoulders. </p><p> They remain forever young.</p><p>Why did some die and others come back? </p><p> Why was Mike Kight killed, while his three brothers returned home? </p><p> We don't have an answer. </p><p> That is the random cruelty of war and the random cruelty of death.</p><p>But those war heroes had something in common. </p><p> And that was courage. </p><p> The dauntless courage of brave young people, who fought for our freedom. </p><p> The kind of courage that should inspire us, in turn. </p><p> Because freedom isn't something we can simply rely on forever. </p><p> It needs to be maintained, defended and passed on.</p><p>And that's our job. </p><p> The fallen will not be forgotten. </p><p> We will continue to speak their names and tell their stories. </p><p> All the graves in Margraten and many of the names on the Tablets of the Missing have been adopted. </p><p> By local people, by families and classes of schoolchildren.  </p><p> Year in, year out, they look after the graves and write to the next of kin. </p><p> So the families know that their loved ones, though fallen, are never forgotten. </p><p> Neither in the United States nor in the Netherlands.</p><p>This illustrates the unbreakable bond between our two countries. </p><p> An age-old bond, which will endure because we cherish the same values. </p><p> We share an unshakeable belief in democracy, freedom and justice. </p><p> And we are prepared to make sacrifices for it - even the ultimate sacrifice. </p><p>Today we, the people of the Netherlands, say thank you. </p><p> We say it with the deepest respect and from the bottom of our hearts. </p><p> We say thank you to our liberators. </p><p> Thank you for enabling us to stand here today in freedom.</p><p>And we bow our heads in memory of the fallen. </p><p> They will live on in our memories and we will hand down their stories. </p><p> Like a little flag in the window, from generation to generation.</p>",0
42,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Have you heard the latest news about Dutch-American ties? Radboud University in Nijmegen has appointed an American as the Netherlands’ first ever professor of cycling. Yes, the Netherlands – the only country with more bikes than people – has asked an American to teach us all about cycling! According to the new professor, Kevin Krizek, cycling is so natural to us Dutch that we forget to do research on it. And that’s where he comes in, because he can offer an outside perspective.</p><p>American visitors to the Netherlands are always struck by our culture of cycling. Take the popular image of a mom on her bike with two kids and three grocery bags, flying cheerfully through the traffic. And other things raise eyebrows too: like our love of salty liquorice. I have a weakness for it myself. And we tend to be blunt in sharing our opinion – or disagreeing with yours!</p><p>But these are trivial differences, the exceptions to the rule. Because the Americans and the Dutch really have a lot in common. For centuries we have shared a deep bond. Why? Because we share the same values. That’s clear from the marvellous book The Island at the Center of the World by Russell Shorto, one of my favourite American writers. Shorto says it wasn’t the British settlers but the liberal city of Amsterdam that had the greatest influence on the American culture of freedom, individualism, tolerance and democracy. And, of course, I couldn’t agree more! I often visit New York – I was there only last week, in fact. And every time I go, I notice the many reminders of the Netherlands’ presence there 400 years ago. Take the street pattern of Lower Manhattan, and places like Brooklyn and Harlem, which are named for the Dutch towns of </p><p>Breukelen</p><p> and </p><p>Haarlem</p><p>. But the energy there is familiar, too. To this very day, New York is keeping Dutch values alive.</p><p>I hope you can feel that same energy here in the Netherlands. The will to innovate and to blaze a trail. Because the thing we share above all is an enterprising spirit. It’s in our DNA. When it comes to doing business, the Dutch and the Americans have the same mentality. We both value efficiency and transparency, so working together is always a pleasure.</p><p>Maybe that’s why our trade figures have been so impressive for so long. The Netherlands is the world’s fifth-biggest investor in the US. That means we account for about 685,000 American jobs. We are the number-one destination for US foreign direct investment. And for the US, we are the gateway to Europe, with the Port of Rotterdam, Amsterdam Airport and our outstanding links to the rest of Europe.</p><p>But, of course, I don’t need to tell you that. After all, the American Chamber of Commerce has played a central role in this story. For more than fifty years AmCham has been giving Dutch-US relations an extra boost. Your organisation has shown that it’s perfectly possible to achieve the American Dream in the Netherlands.</p><p>In economic terms, we’ve had some tough times. But the good news is that things are getting brighter. Both literally and figuratively, spring has arrived. Growth is picking up, investment is on the rise and exports are growing. And, fortunately, even in the difficult years, US interest in the Netherlands has never wavered. You can see that from the turnout here today. </p><p>The recovery is largely thanks to companies like yours. Because businesses and entrepreneurs are the engine of economic growth. The government can make sure the right conditions are in place, but companies have to make it happen. They have to spot the opportunities and clear the obstacles. That’s how you create jobs. That’s how you make an economy grow.</p><p>We aren’t there yet, but we’ve taken the first steps. We’re definitely on the up, and so are Dutch-American relations.</p><p>A big step in the right direction will be wrapping up the TTIP negotiations. Free trade has brought enormous benefits for the US and the Netherlands alike. I don’t need to tell you that, either. TTIP could be a major stimulus for growth, jobs and innovation in both our countries. At the moment, public opinion is focused on the negative sides of the agreement. Of course there are some tricky areas: we have to be very careful and we must take people’s concerns seriously. It’s a long and complex process. But more than anything, it’s a process that deserves our full support. Governments can’t do this alone. We need your input. Let’s work together – government and business – and put all our weight behind this agreement.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>I’d like to thank you all – members of the American Chamber of Commerce – for another year of tireless effort on behalf of Dutch-US relations. I’d like to raise a glass to our unbreakable ties, and to the bright future ahead of us. I’ve said it already: we’re on the up!</p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
43,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>When I opened the first Yes!Delft building on Rotterdamseweg 10 years ago as State Secretary for Education, almost no one had heard of 'start-ups'. I bet the word wasn’t even in the Dutch dictionary. But nowadays it's on everyone's lips, from TV presenters to senior citizens.</p><p>That shows how much has changed. How much has been achieved over the past decade. Since 2005 Yes!Delft has spawned a 150 businesses, generated more than 1000 jobs and invested over a € 110 million euros. Companies like Senz and Ampelmann made their names here. You can be proud of what you've accomplished. Congratulations!</p><p>Yes!Delft began with a brilliant idea, but faced challenges along the way. It's been a real voyage of discovery. A lot has changed in that time. For example: the selection of businesses is much stricter. And there are more and more foreign start-ups.</p><p>On a larger scale: over the past decade the Netherlands has become one of the most enterprising countries in the world. 1 in 8 Dutch people earns a living as an entrepreneur. 2014 saw the launch of another 65.000 companies. So there are now nearly 1,5 million businesses in the Netherlands – a record number.</p><p>This rapid increase began at the same time Yes!Delft was born. That can't be a coincidence!</p><p>It's a trend that reflects a changing labour market. Many of today's young people are likely to become entrepreneurs at some point in their career. And organisations like Yes!Delft are helping them from an early age. By showing students that they can set up their own business and by providing the tools for success. It's an organisation you want to be part of.</p><p>To put it another way: Yes!Delft is an engine of innovation. And that's very important for the Netherlands in several ways.</p><p>Some people are cynical about the focus on economic growth, enterprise and innovation. Is it really that important? The answer is yes.</p><p>Because innovation allows us to solve the big challenges of today and tomorrow. Complex challenges like an ageing population and climate change. Questions like: Where will our energy come from in 2050? How will we feed everyone? How can the Netherlands keep up in an increasingly competitive world? How can we retain our leading role?</p><p>The answer is: through pioneering innovations and enterprise. That's why they're so crucial.</p><p>What can we expect over the next decade? Where will we be in 2025?</p><p>The new director of Yes!Delft, Pieter Guldemond, has said that you're ready for the next step. I think he's right.</p><p>Let me mention some of the challenges I see for the next decade:</p><p>Of course, innovators don't have to be that young. Take Neelie Kroes. She's been coming up with innovative ideas all her life. That's why she's a special envoy for one of our government's main ambitions: to make the Netherlands Europe's prime business location for start-ups.</p><p>Thanks to organisations like Yes!Delft, this ambition is fast becoming reality.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Steve Jobs once said: 'Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.' We can safely say that there are plenty of leaders here at Yes!Delft. I'm sure that over the next decade Yes!Delft will continue to fulfil its motto: 'Building tomorrow's leading firms'.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",1
44,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Welcome to the Netherlands and welcome to The Hague.</p><p>Bill Gates once said, ‘The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.’ It’s a fitting metaphor. The town square is where we meet and talk to each other, and buy and sell. But there are also cheats and pickpockets about.</p><p>The internet makes the global local: the entire world is a mouse-click away. There are plenty of opportunities, but there are threats too. And they are harder to manage than the dangers you find in the average town square. Because the global town square is virtual. It’s enormous. And it’s getting bigger. In 1992 there were a million internet users. Today it’s three billion and counting. The internet has changed our entire way of life. Information, media, our social contacts and the economy – we rely on the World Wide Web for all of this now. In many ways, that’s a good thing. But it also brings new forms of dependency and new security risks. Take cybercrime: the likely annual cost of cybercrime to the global economy is more than 400 billion dollars.</p><p>So there is a lot at stake. We need to invest in security so that legitimate users will benefit and criminals will think twice. And we want to fully realise the internet’s innovative and economic potential. So I’m delighted that so many of you have come to The Hague. And I’m glad to see that you represent the full spectrum of interests, from countries and businesses to civil society organisations. Because we all need to work together as partners to make sure the internet remains free, open and secure.</p><p>This is an important topic for the Netherlands. Because the Netherlands is an internet hub and a gateway to the Web. We have the fastest internet connections in the world.</p><p>We have a flourishing creative industry, with lots of ICT talent, app developers and start-ups. We are also home to companies like Google and Huawei, which have offices and investments in our country.</p><p>We have something worth defending. So the Netherlands will continue investing in our internet infrastructure, knowledge infrastructure, cyber security and cyber diplomacy.</p><p>I want to emphasise that. Not least in the light of our candidacy for a seat on the UN Security Council for the 2017 to 2018 period.</p><p>The internet works by connecting people, businesses and countries. We want to safeguard that connectivity and we have to do that by working together. That is what this conference is all about.</p><p>For the next two days, you will be focusing on the dilemmas of cyberspace. The internet raises questions that aren’t always easy to answer. Security versus privacy. Economic opportunities versus cyber security. Protecting internet freedom versus safeguarding national security. And opinions differ on these important issues. So there is plenty to talk about in the next two days. And we hope to come up with specific agreements and solutions. For example, we will look at the scope for norms of state conduct in cyberspace.</p><p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>The internet offers countless opportunities in every area, including economic development. But its reliability must be beyond doubt. We want our global town square to be vibrant and to flourish. We want it to be a place where people feel safe. That is the goal of the GCCS and that is why you have come to The Hague. I wish you a successful conference.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",5
45,"<p>President Xi, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Asia and Europe are getting closer and closer. The classic image is still true: an endless stream of sea containers travelling from Busan and Shanghai to Hamburg and, of course, Rotterdam. But these days it’s certainly not the whole story. Ties between the two regions have become more direct, broader and closer than ever. I see that clearly in the Netherlands. Asian investors active in my country are very careful to choose activities that add value to their own knowledge and experience. Recent examples include the takeovers of a big Dutch waste processing company, a pension insurer and even the football club in my own town – The Hague, the seat of Dutch government and the legal capital of the world.</p><p>Compared with shipping freight, investing in football expertise in the country of Johan Cruyff is a whole new ball game. I think it’s a positive trend. After all, the recent economic crisis showed once again how intertwined everything is in the global economy. Bilateral interregional trade flows between Asia and Europe are already the largest worldwide. So we depend on each other – that’s a fact. For example, financial stability in the eurozone directly influences growth rates in Asian countries. And the rise of a prosperous middle-class in large parts of Asia is crucial for Europe’s future. It’s no accident that governments, business and universities are working together constantly – at both bilateral and multilateral level – to enhance economic cooperation.</p><p>Along the way, it’s become clear how much those shared economic interests are linked to other major issues of our day. Because looking ahead, Asia and Europe face many of the same challenges. Take our future energy supplies. Or growing demand for safe, adequate food supplies and high-quality, yet affordable medical care for an ageing population. Or the question of social responsibility – overarching issues relating to labour, capital and the environment. Or how to deal with the consequences of climate change, like rising sea level.</p><p>So my message today is clear. The theme of the 2015 Boao Forum, ‘Towards a Community of Common Destiny’, transcends the borders of the Asian continent. We must keep building partnerships that link East and West and make us both stronger. We can do more for people’s well-being and prosperity by joining forces than if it we go it alone. That must be our goal in this ongoing process. And there can be no doubt that sustainability – in every sense of the word – is becoming an imperative. So it’s also a very promising business case.</p><p>I’m speaking here as the representative of a country renowned for its focus on the future. Dutch businesses are leaders in fields that will determine the future of our planet. Like life sciences, energy, water management and, last but not least, agri-food. Mr. President, our fruitful discussions on food & agriculture during your succesfull State Visit to the Netherlands, has led to the establishment of the Holland Center in China. With the investment of the China Development Center, the Holland Center has set up a 50-km2 project in Beijing FengTai district, a project to help China modernise its food & agriculture, integrated with modern urbanization.</p><p>The CEO of Huawei Netherlands recently praised the Netherlands for its ‘culture of openness and innovation’. Conversely, the presence of Huawei and many other Asian companies gives my country great dynamism and innovative power. The resulting growth of people-to-people contacts feeds a permanent flow of ideas that bodes well for our common future. Because as the great philosopher Confucius once said, ‘All people are the same, it’s only their habits that differ.’ In other words, the things that unite us are stronger than the things that divide us. In that spirit, let us continue to invest in our partnership, and let us continue to learn from each other.</p><p>I wish all the participants in the Boao Forum many inspiring encounters.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",4
46,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>These days Dutch media are full of reports about China – which makes perfect sense. Because even though our countries are thousands of kilometres apart, the Netherlands and China enjoy ever closer ties.</p><p>I recently read an interview in a Dutch newspaper with Wang Dexian, the CEO of the Huawei telecoms company in the Netherlands. A man known as ‘Wonder Wang’, thanks to his remarkable achievements. Huawei is very active in my country, building 4G networks, providing local government intranet and installing Wi-Fi in Amsterdam’s football stadium.</p><p>Well-known Dutch chains like the drug store Kruidvat, ICI Paris XL and waste processing company AVR are now partly owned by Chinese companies. And Dutch businesses are focusing on China like never before. That’s clear from their keenness to take part in this and other trade missions. For years, the Netherlands has been one of China’s top three trade partners in Europe. In 2014 mutual trade totalled almost 44 billion euros and it’s still growing.</p><p>Where does this mutual interest come from? Perhaps because, despite our differences, we also have things in common. When Wang Dexian was asked why Huawei had opted to base three offices in the Netherlands, he answered ‘because of the [Dutch] openness and the culture of innovation.’</p><p>That culture of innovation isn’t found only in the Netherlands. It’s in China, too, and that creates a bond. It makes us curious about each other. It makes us want to learn from each other. And where better to do that than here, in this city?</p><p>More patents are applied for in Shenzhen than anywhere else in China. According to Forbes magazine, it’s the most inventive city in China. And Forbes has named Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, as the most inventive city in the world. We must exploit this wealth of ideas, this blossoming of invention, both here and in the Netherlands. And that’s why we’re here today. There are now 36 Dutch companies in Shenzhen. But we need many more, and I’m very optimistic about the opportunities.</p><p>Opportunities to do business and opportunities to share knowledge. In fact, partner cities Almere and Shenzhen are already doing that. At first glance, you might think they had little to offer each other. Shenzhen has a population of 14 million – Almere fewer than 200,000. Yet the two have a lot in common. They are both urban growth centres near a large metropolis. And many of their inhabitants were not born there, but come from elsewhere. Almere and Shenzhen help each other with urban planning, for instance. Take transport networks. How can railways, airports, cycle paths and roads be linked most effectively?</p><p>That culture of innovation, here and in the Netherlands, also helps us to address the common challenges our countries face. How do we ensure safe and adequate food supplies for an ever-growing population? What forms of energy will be available to us in 2050? These are issues that Europe and China are tackling. And it’s precisely here that our innovative power is so useful.</p><p>Wang Dexian chose the Netherlands because of its openness and culture of innovation. But, as he says in the interview, ‘We also discovered later that the Netherlands is a good gateway to Europe.’ Indeed, the port of Rotterdam, Amsterdam Airport and excellent links to the rest of Europe mean that my country has a lot to offer in this respect. That was why President Xi Jinping chose the Netherlands as his first European destination for a state visit.</p><p>Trade has always been at the heart of our relationship. But we have also grown more and more curious about each other, and each other’s culture. In 2014 the number of Chinese tourists in the Netherlands increased by an impressive 18 per cent. I see this trend myself, from my office in The Hague – crowds of Chinese tourists walk by every day. And this city is a place where different cultures meet and inspire each other. For instance at the Shenzhen Bi-City Biennale of Architecture/Urbanism, where a Dutch creative director has been appointed.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, it’s plain that Sino-Dutch ties are getting closer. Because despite all our differences, we have plenty in common. And when something’s unfamiliar, we want to learn more about it. That’s true of both our cultures.</p><p>There are great opportunities to be seized on both sides. And that’s of course a matter for you, not me. Because although good contacts at the highest political level are important, in the end it’s all about companies. They’re the ones doing the business.</p><p>Let me conclude with a saying by Confucius. He said that we have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak. So I’d best leave the talking to you now, while I listen! Thank you again for receiving us in this inspiring city. And here’s to a meal that will prove equally inspiring!</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
47,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>I recently read an interview with a Rotterdam-based healthcare professional who does a lot of business with partners in Shanghai. He said: ‘If the Chinese have a problem, they will travel the world to find the best solution.’</p><p>And I’m happy to say: they seem to find that solution, more and more, in the Netherlands. Take the enormous increase in Chinese investment in Dutch companies. Or the growing number of Chinese students and researchers at our universities.</p><p>The Dutch media are full of reports about Chinese activities in our country. Like the recent investment in a Dutch pension insurer and even in the football club of my own city, The Hague. It’s clear that all those sea containers full of goods travelling from Shanghai to Rotterdam are only one side of the story. People-to-people contacts are also flourishing. This has triggered a flood of knowledge, experience and ideas in all kinds of fields, sometimes in surprising areas. For instance, that healthcare professional I quoted is working with partners from Shanghai to improve care for elderly people with dementia.</p><p>And that flow of people, knowledge and ideas goes both ways. As it has for centuries. Because the Dutch, too, know that to move forward you have to push the boundaries. That was true back in the 17th century, when the first Dutch ships were sighted off the coast of China. And it’s true now. For years, the Netherlands has been one of China’s top three trading partners in Europe, and the third-biggest European investor in Shanghai. In 2014 mutual trade between the Netherlands and Shanghai totalled over eight billion dollars. And it’s still growing. Those are impressive figures. But there’s always room for improvement. And that’s why I’m here, in Shanghai, with a big trade delegation. To open doors and close deals.</p><p>It makes perfect sense that Shanghai plays a special role in the relationship between the Netherlands and China. The world’s biggest port is bound by many ties to Rotterdam, Europe’s biggest port. Ties of business. And ties of friendship. What’s more, Shanghai is an economic hotspot to rival any in the world. This city alone generates no less than one-eighth of China’s total income. It’s bursting with energy. You feel that as soon as you land here. It’s a cosmopolitan, vibrant city. With enviable growth figures. And great potential for international businesses, thanks in part to the Free Trade Zone. And that’s why we Dutch like to come here.</p><p>Around 3,000 Dutch people live and work in Shanghai. It’s also home to around 800 businesses that are directly or indirectly based in the Netherlands. That’s a lot – but it makes sense. Because despite our social and cultural differences, we have a lot in common. Our spirit of enterprise. Our culture of innovation. Our pragmatic mindset and result-based approach. We’re always looking for the best solutions to current and future challenges. That’s what binds us. That’s what will take us forward.</p><p>I was delighted that President Xi Jinping chose the Netherlands for his first European state visit. A logical choice, because the Netherlands is the gateway to Europe. But as the president could see, the country’s appeal doesn’t lie only in its excellent infrastructure, the port of Rotterdam, Schiphol airport and our links to the rest of Europe. It also lies in our spirit of enterprise. And our enquiring, pragmatic and innovative nature.</p><p>The Netherlands is a small country that does big business. We’re the seventeenth-biggest economy in the world and the second-biggest agricultural exporter after the United States. Dutch companies lead the way in expertise on agri-food, water management and life sciences. Fields that will determine the future of our planet. Especially of densely populated regions like Shanghai. So this city was a natural location for the Holland Centre, opened here by the Dutch foreign trade minister, Lilianne Ploumen, in October last year. The Holland Centre works to boost partnerships between Dutch and Chinese agri-food companies.</p><p>Today I attended the seminar ‘The Power of Cooperation. Past, Present and Future’. And I heard about many innovative joint ventures in the agri-food sector. Take the Sino-Dutch Dairy Development Centre – a partnership between Wageningen University, China Agricultural University, Friesland Campina CRV and Beijing Zhongdi Breeding Company Limited. They’re working together to improve the quality, safety and yield of local dairy produce.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, when President Xi visited the Netherlands in March last year, he and I agreed to step up the excellent cooperation between our two countries. And you can see we’re on the right track. But it’s not only down to us. On the contrary. The real business is being done by companies like those here today. So seize your chance, talk to each other, get to know each other. So we can help each other find the best solutions. Here’s to an inspiring partnership!</p>",2
48,"<p>Mr Borgas, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Not long ago, one of my favourite American authors, Russell Shorto, published a marvellous book about the history of Amsterdam. He calls it the world’s 'most liberal city', a centre of creativity and bold international enterprise. He also describes other characteristics. A never-ending quest for consensus and continuity, for instance. And a tradition of dependable governance. Shorto links the special character of Amsterdam – individual yet collective – to two things. First, that feudalism never got a foothold here. Second, the age-old battle against the water, which forced the Dutch to work together. I can recommend that you read his book if you get the chance.</p><p>Mr Borgas, I remember how, a while back, over breakfast in Tel Aviv, we talked about where you would locate ICL’s European head office. But I like to think Amsterdam was the only possible choice! Because for centuries, it’s been known for its mix of dynamism and reliability. Since the days of the Dutch East India Company, Amsterdam – and indeed, the Netherlands as a whole – has been an international centre of economic activity. With top-quality services, excellent infrastructure, highly-skilled professionals, a pleasant living environment and a great deal more. That makes it attractive as a base for foreign companies. And all those foreign companies in turn make our open, outward-looking economy stronger and more dynamic. It’s a win-win situation.</p><p>So I’m delighted to welcome ICL’s European head office to Amsterdam and the Netherlands. ICL is already quite at home here, with production sites in Heerlen, Waardenburg, Terneuzen and Amsterdam. And this new head office will make the ties between ICL and the Netherlands even stronger. That’s something we welcome. After all, we’re talking about an investment of several million euros, as well as 300 new jobs. About growth potential for the port of Amsterdam – whose new sea lock will boost its appeal even more. And about a company that’s a global player in the production of minerals and fertilisers – so it ties in directly with the Dutch top sectors: agri-food, chemicals, and life sciences & health.</p><p>Clearly, there are plenty of opportunities for mutual benefit. Because ICL, too, is big on innovation. And with this new European head office, there’s even more scope for partnership in this field. I’m sure that in Wageningen and elsewhere, doors will open wide for you. As they should in an open, international and high-value economy like we have here, and want to preserve. </p><p>I congratulate the city of Amsterdam on securing this top company and its superb head office. I also congratulate and thank the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, which played an important role. But above all I congratulate you, Mr Borgas, on a fine and sensible choice. This is a great day for Amsterdam, for the Netherlands and for ICL. And to mark that, I would like to offer you this small welcoming gift. I hope you like it as much as I did.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
49,"<p>'Yesterday in Paris twelve people were murdered in cold blood. Twelve gatekeepers of freedom. Including our freedom.</p><p>Today we are gathered here on Dam Square in Amsterdam, and in towns all over the Netherlands. United in outrage. United in anger. But above all, united in our unshakable conviction.</p><p>And we are not alone. Everywhere in Europe, people are standing side by side, shoulder to shoulder. In solidarity with France, with the victims and with the victims' loved ones. We are here to say that hatred and violence must never and will never defeat respect and tolerance. We are here because freedom and democracy are non-negotiable. There is simply no such thing as being half free. And while freedom implies responsibility, it must never mean self-censorship. </p><p>We will not let fear govern our lives. We will not let anyone take away our freedom. That is the message that we are sending tonight, loud and clear. Here on Dam Square, and in many other places. On this there is complete consensus. And whatever differences people may have, this is what binds us together, with each other and with the victims of yesterday's attack. Our common awareness that our democracy is precious but vulnerable and that we must come together in defending it. Every day, and especially on a day like today.</p><p>Our country and its neighbours have room for everyone's beliefs and everyone's convictions. This freedom is not always easy to live with. Because it does not only protect opinions we are comfortable with, compliments and innocuous commentary. Freedom also protects unwelcome and caustic criticism, sharp disagreement and sarcastic mockery. That is the essence of democracy. It is at the heart of true freedom.</p><p>After all, what is the first thing that dictators forbid? Making fun of authority. The freedom to criticise and make fun of authority is the ultimate proof that we are civilised people. That we never try to silence each other. The murderers tried to kill free speech yesterday by taking aim at journalists. We must answer them with words: loud words, strong words, free words. The murderers tried to kill our sense of security yesterday by executing police officers. We must answer them by showing solidarity with our police. By protecting one another. By cherishing mockery, satire and jokes about everyone and everything. </p><p>There is no place in our society for fundamentalist violence and intolerance. And this cowardly murder of twelve people only strengthens us in this conviction. What happened yesterday in Paris shows how real and close the threat of terror is. We are and will remain alert. Together, we are and will remain vigilant.</p><p>What it comes down to is this: yesterday fanatics carried out a barbaric attack, which touches us all. Today we are responding in the thousands: Keep your hands off our freedom. Since yesterday, the voice of Charlie Hebdo is more pervasive and more powerful than ever. And that is the best answer we can give.' </p>",0

But also in the future. </p><p> Today we will read their names aloud. </p><p> They will not be forgotten. </p><p> The memories you have of them – beautiful, heart-warming and moving memories – will remain with you always. </p><p> Your own unique memories of unique individuals. </p><p> Yet individuals who perhaps had one thing in common. </p><p> They lived in the here and now, and were full of vitality and plans. </p><p> That is clear from nearly all the personal accounts we heard and read after July seventeenth. </p><p> Wouldn’t it be good to take something of their strength into our future? </p><p> In that way, they will live on. </p><p> In that way, they will remain a source of inspiration. </p><p> In that way, they will remain near to us.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>What if this should happen? </p><p> What if you succeed in finding comfort and hope in their legacy, in all the good they leave behind? </p><p> What if the courage to go on lies in those everlasting and loving memories?</p><p>I wish that for you. </p><p> We wish that for you. </p><p> With all our hearts.</p>",0

Today Prime Minister Abbott has demonstrated the same personal commitment to this issue he showed when he visited the Netherlands in August.

I would like to see us broaden and deepen those ties even further in the future – at political, economic and cultural level.</p>",1
53,"<p>Selamat datang! [welkom] </p><p> It's a great pleasure to be here in this beautiful part of Kuala Lumpur. Although I greatly value this opportunity to meet you, this is a sad occasion. </p><p> Like the Netherlands Malaysia has known an immense tragedy recently. Not only the downing of MH17, but also the disappearance of MH370. </p><p> My main purpose in visiting Malaysia is to express my sympathy and my gratitude to the Malaysian authorities for their assistance and cooperation in the aftermath of flight MH17, and to ensure further close and constructive collaboration.</p><p>I realise that this recent collaboration in the political and legal field has a solid basis in the many years of strong economic bonds between Malaysia and the Netherlands. </p><p> So I consider this meeting with you the business community and members of the MDBC an integral part of my visit. </p><p> Your performance contributes to a profile in Malaysia of a country that can be trusted. If the disaster affected you directly or indirectly I would like to offer you my deepest sympathy. </p><p> And I would like to express my admiration for your resilience. </p><p>The Dutch Malaysian business community is part of a long history of Dutch enterprise in Malaysia. It is vibrant and successful. </p><p> Dutch entrepreneurs have been in this country for 160 years - 8 generations. </p><p>Long experience and know-how do not go unnoticed. </p><p> MDBC is known as one of the most active and successful councils of its kind in Malaysia. </p><p> A quick glance at the members' guide shows that all the Dutch multinationals have a presence here. </p><p> So do many SMEs and start-ups.</p><p>I spoke to a number of you this morning. </p><p> You all have your own interesting stories of continued hard work in a faraway market.

56,"<p>Mr President, </p><p> Mr Secretary-General, </p><p> Excellencies, </p><p> fellow delegates, </p><p> ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>On 17 July, in a summer already marked by alarming reports from Syria, Iraq and Gaza, our country was confronted with stark international reality. The 298 passengers of flight MH17 would be alive today if not for the Crimea conflict and the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine. 196 of the victims were Dutch nationals. This tragedy has had an enormous impact on our country. So many innocent men, women and children. Entire families ripped from neighbourhoods, empty desks in offices and schools, teammates gone forever. Everyone in the Netherlands knew someone in that plane, directly or indirectly, and we will feel the pain for years to come. Some of the victims still haven't been identified, and this must be done as soon as possible. Nothing is more important to their loved ones, wherever in the world they may be.</p><p>This summer we were reminded again of how closely interwoven events at home and abroad can be. And how important a stable world order is to our national interests. We saw again that when it comes to addressing the major problems facing the global community, there is simply no alternative to working together and taking a multilateral approach. This is the firm conviction of the Dutch government. We are grateful for the wide support for Security Council resolution 2166. All remains and personal belongings need to be repatriated. The cause of the MH17 disaster must be brought to light and those responsible must be brought to justice. Unhindered access to the crash site is therefore essential. The Dutch government is fully committed to achieving these goals, working with all the countries and organisations involved.</p><p>The Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands contains a unique article that says: 'The Government shall promote the development of the international legal order'. This self-imposed responsibility comes from a long tradition of freedom, respect for the rule of law and our country's international orientation. In March 2014 we put this principle into practice once again when we hosted the Nuclear Security Summit, a conference on an important topic that must remain high on the international agenda. The events of this summer have made us even more resolute about promoting the international legal order. And about working to this end with everyone in this General Assembly, in the knowledge that peace, justice and development are closely interconnected.</p><p>2015 is an important year for the global development agenda. We will be reviewing the Millennium Development Goals and raising the bar once again. In July the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals laid a solid foundation for the future that reflects the Netherlands' priorities. The most important goal is to eradicate extreme poverty within a generation in a way that doesn't harm economic growth, social equality or the environment. We must link short-term goals with long-term goals.</p><p>And despite the progress made, we know that fragile states, where the rule of law barely exists, had no chance of achieving the Millennium Goals. In 2013 there were more displaced people in conflict regions than ever before. For these reasons the Netherlands applauds the Open Working Group's intention to include peace and the rule of law in the new framework. We welcome the initiative by the SG to establish the UN mission for ebola emergency response. The Netherlands will substantially increase its humanitarian aid. Part of that effort is a new contribution of 18 mln euros devoted to fighting ebola.</p><p>In the same vein, the Netherlands will continue to support and participate in UN peacekeeping missions. We currently have military personnel and relief workers serving in Mali, South Sudan and elsewhere. The upcoming review of peacekeeping missions is an opportunity to improve this instrument and make it more effective. The Netherlands believes that major progress can be made on this front by further integrating the three Ds: defence, development and diplomacy. Our commitment to fulfilling Security Council resolution 1325 remains firm too. Because women's leadership is essential to achieving peace and security. The important role that women play as change agents in politics, economic development and society cannot be emphasised enough. As host country to many international legal institutions, including the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court, the Netherlands feels a special responsibility with respect to international law. When innocent people fall victim to impunity, human rights violations and the violence of war, the international community cannot and should not just stand by and watch. Perpetrators must be brought to justice, however complex and time-consuming the process may be.</p><p>We owe this not only to the passengers of flight MH17, but also to the victims of violence in Syria and Iraq. The horrifying images of mass executions and beheadings in the region are burned into our memories. They impress upon us how important it is for the Security Council and international legal institutions to be able to act boldly and decisively.</p><p>The Kingdom of the Netherlands, your partner for peace, justice and development, is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council in 2017 and 2018. We want to help modernise and strengthen this important UN body. Renewal is needed to ensure its effectiveness and legitimacy. The Security Council must be able to act in a crisis. When mass atrocities are being committed somewhere in the world, veto power should be exercised with greater restraint. We salute the French initiative in this regard. We also believe that the Security Council's authority and resolve would be enhanced if the UN member states were more broadly represented. This is especially true of the African states, which in our opinion are underrepresented.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p> Dag Hammarskjöld once said in this assembly that the principles of the Charter of the United Nations '[…] are, by far, greater than the Organization in which they are embodied, and the aims which they are to safeguard are holier than the policies of any single nation or people.'</p><p>The Netherlands shares this conviction and remains steadfast in its commitment to promoting the international legal order, as our Constitution demands. </p><p> Thank you.</p>",2
57,"<p>Madam President,</p><p>The direct threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters concerns us all. Both our international and our national security are at risk. As a country of origin for such fighters, the Netherlands raised its terrorist threat level to the second highest level eighteen months ago.</p><p>But most alarming of all is the situation in the conflict zones themselves. Innocent civilians are victims of merciless violence. The threat is serious, and it calls for a serious response. This is a duty that rests on us, the international community. That is also the reason why today the Dutch government decided to increase its support to the international effort to stop ISIS by providing military means. We will provide F16's and military training and advice. In total we provide 380 men and women.</p><p>Last year, in the framework of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) the Netherlands and Morocco launched a joint initiative to formulate good practices in tackling the problem of foreign terrorist fighters. Yesterday, at the GCTF ministerial meeting, we presented the outcome: a comprehensive set of guidelines focused on every aspect of the foreign fighter threat. These recommendations cover not only counterterrorism responses, but also preventive efforts.</p><p>As co-leader of the Forum’s working group on foreign terrorist fighters, the Netherlands will promote the adoption of these good practices. We are open to working actively with all UN member states and UN partners on this issue.</p><p>The UN sanctions regime is essential to addressing the problem of foreign terrorist fighters. Sanctions are an important instrument for depriving terrorist organisations and fighters of their sources of finance. And sanctions could be tightened further. These sanctions, however, must be implemented and monitored properly. Or they won’t be effective in practice. We should, I believe, examine at UN level whether the monitoring and technical assistance provided to member states can be enhanced.</p><p>Madam President,</p><p>It is vital that the international community act jointly on this issue. The resolution adopted today and cosponsored by the Netherlands, sends a strong signal that we should stand shoulder to shoulder to confront the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters.</p><p>Madam President, thank you.</p>",0
58,"<p>Secretary-General, esteemed colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>At some point you may have landed at Amsterdam Airport without realising that the runway was over four metres below sea level. </p><p> This is a good example of our geography as a low-lying delta region. </p><p> Without dams and dikes, more than half our country would be under water all or part of the time. </p><p> So you can imagine that climate change and its effects are a major concern in my country, and we are determined to take action.</p><p>In brief, my message to you today is: if we act now and if we act together, we can mitigate climate change and we can adapt to the physical and environmental challenges we face. </p><p> Both sides of this equation are important. </p><p> And in both cases, cooperation is crucial.</p><p>First and foremost, I mean international cooperation between countries and regions, and our shared responsibility to confront climate change. </p><p> That's why we're here. </p><p> That's why we aim to forge an ambitious climate agreement next year in Paris. </p><p> All countries must contribute in line with their ability. </p><p> This principle will be set down in the new climate agreement, and we have  to make it happen. </p><p> For example, with the help of the new Green Climate Fund, which the Netherlands is keen to contribute to.</p><p>But in order to achieve our international ambitions, it is also vital for government authorities, businesses and civil society organisations to work together at national level. </p><p> Last year, the Netherlands reached a deal with 40 different partners, from Shell to Greenpeace. </p><p> Our common goal is energy innovation, and in this way we will ensure that the Netherlands meets - and even exceeds - its climate goals for 2020. </p><p> My country will cancel an extra 14 million tons of CO2 credits. </p><p> Many other countries in the EU have a similar story to tell.</p><p>The target is a 20 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions in Europe between 1990 and 2020. </p><p> The Netherlands believes that the European target for 2030 should be at least twice that, and for 2050, 80 to 95%. This is very ambitious, but experience teaches that we can accomplish a lot by forming broad coalitions.</p><p>We need to keep using incentives to encourage climate innovation. </p><p> For example, by putting a price tag on CO2 emissions, like the European Emissions Trading Scheme. </p><p> Our philosophy is simple: making sustainability a business case is the best guarantee for a successful climate policy. </p><p> Green growth pays. </p><p> There is a future to be won, and money to be made.</p><p>The focus on cooperation is also visible in the way we in the Netherlands deal with the effects of climate change. </p><p> In our case, this means preparing for a rising sea level and higher peak discharges in the major rivers that flow through our country. </p><p> If Amsterdam Airport is five metres below sea level in a hundred years, planes will still have to be able to land safely. </p><p> That's our mission.</p><p>This battle against water is not new for us, of course. </p><p> But the need to act is clearer and more compelling than ever. </p><p> With this in mind, we've launched a special delta programme in which central government works with municipalities and the water sector. </p><p> The programme is institution-based and well-funded, and it runs all the way to the next century. </p><p> For the first time in our long history of water management, we are not trying to deal with the previous disaster, but looking to the future, to prevent a new one.</p><p>Our special relationship with water and all the specific know-how we've built up over the years brings with it a special responsibility to share this knowledge, exchange expertise and offer assistance. </p><p> The Dutch government and business community are more than willing to do so, especially in developing countries, where large numbers of people and a lot of economic activity are concentrated in low-lying deltas. </p><p> But every country is vulnerable to some degree. </p><p> In this city, which was hit so hard by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, it is fitting to mention the Resilient Cities Initiative, which is sharing state-of-the-art knowledge on water safety with 2,000 cities worldwide. </p><p> We in the Netherlands are also doing our part in this regard. </p><p> And we will continue to do so.</p><p>So, ladies and gentleman, let's act. Let's act now and let's act together. </p><p>Thank you.</p>",1
59,"<p>Your Majesty, </p><p> Your Excellencies, </p><p> ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>I recently read in the paper about a new study at the University of Wageningen. Researchers there are analysing the DNA of generations of Dutch dairy cows. This genetic information tells them whether a cow is likely to produce a lot of milk and whether it will remain healthy. That way, productive cows can be bred without the need for antibiotics. Smart research like this helps feed more mouths and improves animal welfare. And that's what sustainable development is all about in 2014. It's not just a matter for politicians. It's companies and universities, not government, that are creating solutions for today's problems and for the future. Of course, government remains a key enabler. We need to work together. </p><p> We need to build broad-based coalitions between government, businesses and consumers. Only then can we solve the major problems of the 21st century, like hunger, poverty and climate change.</p><p>2015 is an important year for the global development agenda. We'll be reviewing the Millennium Development Goals and raising the bar once again. In July the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals laid a solid foundation for the future that reflects the Netherlands' priorities. We share the hope for a better future and the ambition to make it happen. At tomorrow's climate summit, government, businesses and civil society will once again join forces to create an ambitious climate agreement. In the Netherlands we're working to do the same on a smaller scale. We're pooling knowledge, expertise and resources to reach major goals that no single party could achieve alone. We're joining hands with municipalities, companies, environmental organisations and other parties to create sustainable energy supplies. But you don't always need the government. Look at the research being done in Wageningen. Or at the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition, set up in 2012 by eight leading multinationals, including, Heineken, KLM, Shell and my former employer Unilever. Together they're developing and sharing sustainable business models. It won't surprise you that Paul Polman, an esteemed member of the High Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, is one of the coalition's leaders.</p><p>It shows the broad support that sustainability now enjoys among the business community. More and more companies are opting for sustainability and corporate social responsibility, in many cases a step ahead of the government.</p><p>Business is leading the way, and not only from noble motives. To quote our host Paul Polman in his speech to the UN: 'it is not just about philanthropy or altruism. It makes business sense.' Sustainability is becoming mainstream. </p><p> Consumers demand it. They want products made in a responsible way. And they stand up to companies who don't meet high standards. Sustainable innovations create income and jobs. So there's a future to be won and money to be made. </p><p> In short, the Sustainable Development Goals can't be achieved without the private sector. Without the University of Wageningen's smart solutions. Without Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan. And without other companies and knowledge centres stepping in. But government plays a role too, bringing companies and research institutions together and promoting sustainable innovation.</p><p>It's all in the theme of this dinner: we're working on a 'transformative change for a brighter future.' </p><p> Thank you.</p>",0
60,"<p>President Battistelli, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Abraham Lincoln once said that the US Patent Office 'adds the flame of interest to the light of creativity'. </p><p> A splendid image, and one that applies to the European Patent Office too. </p><p> Patents oil the wheels of economic innovation - a process that never stops. </p><p> It requires creative, technically-gifted people, who are free to experiment and think outside the box. </p><p> But it also involves hard commercial interests. </p><p> Businesses and investors want their euro, dollar or yen to yield a profit, and rightly so. </p><p> A good patent system ensures that risk and return are in balance. </p><p> That's why the EPO has been a driving force behind innovation and economic growth for over forty years.</p><p>The Netherlands was a pioneer of European cooperation in this area. </p><p> And that's no accident. </p><p> Our country has many knowledge-intensive companies, makes many patent applications, and benefits from an efficient European market. </p><p> Two weeks ago we were happy to learn that we had moved from fourth to third place on the list of most innovative European economies. </p><p> And last year the number of Dutch applications to the EPO rose seventeen per cent, to over seven and a half thousand. </p><p> That's one hundred and twenty-nine applications for every million inhabitants - more than in Germany, Japan and the United States.</p><p>We all know that the bigger the international focus of patent policy, the more international business benefits. </p><p> So I'm very pleased that we can finally take a big step towards a single European patent - something the EU agreed in 2013. </p><p> Most member states are on board and that's good news for European business: less expense, less red tape and one Unified Patent Court to deal with disputes. </p><p> It's taken a while, but this key addition to the internal market is finally taking shape. </p><p> I'd like to thank the European Patent Office for the vital contribution it has made. </p><p> The new building here in Rijswijk is a sign that you have confidence in the future. </p><p> That you are ready for a new phase, in which you will also be responsible for implementing the European patent. </p><p> The building will be ultra-sustainable, a shining example of innovation, and proof of your determination to remain the global benchmark for quality. </p><p> And by choosing a Franco-Dutch design team - Jean Nouvel of Paris and Dam and Partners Architecten of Amsterdam - you are also symbolising the importance of European cooperation in the field of patents.</p><p>In short, this is a festive occasion for many players: for Europe, for the European Patent Office, for innovative European businesses and all enterprising universities. </p><p> And above all for the Netherlands - especially The Hague and Rijswijk. </p><p> As the biggest international organisation in the Netherlands, the European Patent Office has been a pillar of the regional economy for forty years. </p><p> But even more important: the new premises will bolster the Netherlands' international image. </p><p> So we are grateful to you.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>The Netherlands and The Hague are happy that the European Patent Office has its home here. </p><p> I wish everyone - architects, builders and all your staff - every success in the coming years. </p><p> Perhaps we will meet again in 2017, when the new building is completed, twenty-five thousand Dutch-European patent applications down the line.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
61,"<p>[Deputy Prime Minister Hai], </p><p> Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Thank you for joining this CEO Round Table. It's the second in a short space of time. </p><p> Only three months ago the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation and the Vietnamese Minister of Industry and Trade held a similar event in the Netherlands.</p><p>Clearly, we have more and more to talk about! </p><p> Trade relations between the Netherlands and Vietnam go back four centuries, when the first Dutch ships reached your shores. </p><p> Today the Netherlands is Vietnam's largest investor and third-biggest trading partner in the European Union. </p><p> In the last decade, the value of trade between our two countries has increased almost tenfold, to 3.6 billion dollars.</p><p>So economic ties between Vietnam and the Netherlands are booming. </p><p> And I'm confident that the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Vietnam will further boost trade and investment to our mutual benefit. </p><p> I strongly believe that Vietnam and the Netherlands are natural allies. </p><p> We are both world players in the export of agricultural products. </p><p> We are both coastal states with strategic locations, and we excel in maritime affairs and logistics. </p><p> And as delta countries, we both face the challenges of climate change, especially in the fields of water management and energy. </p><p> So I've come to Vietnam with representatives of major Dutch companies active in these four sectors of mutual interest: water and maritime affairs, agriculture and energy.</p><p>The fact that we're holding another Round Table shows that Dutch companies want to do more business in Vietnam. </p><p> There are already around 120 firms active here. </p><p> Some of the companies in my delegation are taking their first steps in the Vietnamese market. </p><p> Others have been in Vietnam for decades. </p><p> And they tell us that Vietnam - with its location, its young, hard-working population and its fast-growing domestic market - provides ample business opportunities. </p><p> But they also tell us about the challenges companies face when doing business here.</p><p>I hope that today we can openly discuss what it will take to fully exploit the economic potential between our countries. </p><p> My government remains committed to helping Vietnam open up its economy, enhance its policies and become more competitive in this emerging region. </p><p> But in the end, it's all down to the business sector. </p><p> Economic growth and employment come about when companies meet and see joint opportunities. </p><p> Because entrepreneurs speak a universal language.</p><p>The rapid growth of trade between our two countries shows how important it is - and how profitable it can be - to invest in relationships. </p><p> To keep reinforcing our ties. </p><p> That's what we're doing today, at this Round Table. </p><p> Our goal is to sow the seeds of future partnerships. </p><p> And I have every confidence we'll succeed.</p><p>I hope you have an inspiring and productive meeting.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",4
62,"<p>Prime Minister Dung, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>What could be more logical than the water partnership between Vietnam and the Netherlands? Especially in the Mekong Delta, a region that has a lot in common with my country. They are both densely-populated, low-lying delta regions of a similar size and population.</p><p>And we face similar challenges as a result of climate change: rising sea levels, changing river water regimes and salt intrusion. That’s why, four years ago, we decided to work together closely in the Mekong Delta Plan. Because when experts from different fields, different cultures and different countries come together, they can learn from each other.</p><p>At the end of 2013 a long-term vision was presented for the Mekong Delta. All international partners were present, including Melanie Schultz van Haegen, the Dutch minister responsible for water management.</p><p>Now it’s time to turn words into deeds. And I’d like to underline the joint call for a strong framework for development, as set out in the partner statement accompanying that vision. To succeed, ambitious, long-term projects like the Mekong Delta Plan need a clear strategy. And they also need to be properly embedded from an institutional and organisational point of view.</p><p>Nobody knows that better than the Dutch. For over a thousand years my country has battled with water. We built dikes to keep our feet dry. We created land from water. We built towns in marshy regions.</p><p>And now, because of climate change, we face new and even bigger challenges. We need to keep doing what we’re good at. But we also need to find new ways of safeguarding our future. And that requires new and different ways of doing things. In my country we’ve drawn up a special law, the Delta Act, which lays down all the necessary arrangements and long-term financing. That’s essential. </p><p>Of course, we gladly share our knowledge and expertise with other delta regions. Not only as an export product, but also because we see it as a duty. And because we know that two heads are better than one.</p><p>For we, in turn, can learn from the people of the Mekong Delta. For centuries they’ve been adapting their way of life to the water, and that’s something that we in the Netherlands are only just learning to do. So we need to help each other, and make each other stronger. The Mekong Delta Plan will help tackle one of the biggest challenges facing the world – how to cope with the impact of climate change.</p><p>The other great challenge, of course, is how to feed nine billion mouths by 2050. Just like the Netherlands, the Mekong Delta is a very fertile region with immense agricultural potential.</p><p>How can this potential best be exploited? How does flood protection relate to the availability of sufficient water of satisfactory quality? And how do we balance the interests of humankind with environmental interests? The Mekong Delta Plan will help address all these questions in a sustainable and integrated way.</p><p>Yesterday Vietnam and the Netherlands signed a strategic partnership arrangement on sustainable agriculture and food security, because in this field, too, we have a lot to offer each other. With a surface area similar to the Mekong Delta, the Netherlands accounts for 7.5 per cent of global food exports, making us the second-largest exporter in the world.</p><p>I hope the Mekong Delta will be equally successful. Vietnam is already a major exporter of agricultural products. And the shift from quantity to quality – evident in recent policy changes – will certainly bring more success in the future. In short, the Mekong Delta Plan promises a great deal, and it’s gratifying that it’s widely supported by the international community. Because although the plan is based on Vietnamese ownership with Dutch support, its implementation calls for a joint effort.</p><p>Together we can put theory into practice, so that the Mekong Delta can develop in a sustainable way. In true partnership, we can make the most of its immense potential.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
63,"<p>Prime Minister, </p><p> Your Excellencies, </p><p> ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>One of the first Dutchmen to set foot in Vietnam - back in 1601 - was the merchant </p><p>Jeronimus Wonderaer</p><p>. </p><p> In his letters home he spoke highly of the hospitality he received in your beautiful country. </p><p> Whatever may have changed since then, that has not, and I would like to thank you - on behalf of the entire Dutch delegation - for the very warm reception you have given us.</p><p>Prime Minister Dung, after your visits to our country, I'm delighted to have the opportunity to visit yours. </p><p> I follow in the footsteps of many of my compatriots, including our current King and Queen, who paid a very successful visit to Vietnam in 2011. </p><p> These bilateral contacts underline the growing importance of the ties between our two countries.</p><p>Last year we celebrated forty years of diplomatic relations and hundreds of thousands of people visited Holland Village in Ho Chi Minh City. </p><p> And more and more Vietnamese and Dutch politicians, business people and experts are getting connected. </p><p> That's no coincidence. </p><p> Of all the EU member states, the Netherlands is the biggest investor in Vietnam and its third-biggest trade partner. </p><p> A hundred and twenty Dutch firms already operate in your country and many others are ready to follow their example. </p><p> In the last decade, trade between the Netherlands and Vietnam has increased nearly tenfold, to 3.6 billion dollars.</p><p>These facts and figures say a lot about the amazing speed of your country's development. </p><p> It fills us with admiration. </p><p> Vietnam's progress has been truly remarkable. </p><p> Your unique location, your young, hard-working population and your open and international outlook make Vietnam what it is today: a vibrant economy with great potential, and an attractive partner for a country like ours.</p><p>I strongly believe that Vietnam and the Netherlands are natural allies. </p><p> Both our countries are world players in the export of agricultural products. </p><p> We are both coastal states with strategic locations, and we excel in maritime affairs and logistics. </p><p> And as delta countries, we both face the challenges of climate change, especially in the fields of water management and energy. </p><p> So I've come to Vietnam with representatives of major Dutch companies that are active in these four sectors of mutual interest: water and maritime affairs, agriculture and energy. </p><p> We're all convinced that we can learn a lot from each other and that doing business will benefit both our countries.</p><p>Back in 2010 we signed a strategic partnership arrangement on water management and climate change adaptation. </p><p> We're now putting that partnership into practice with the Mekong Delta Plan, which brings together Vietnamese and Dutch expertise in the field of water. </p><p> The plan combines flood protection with great opportunities for the agricultural sector. </p><p> I look forward to our talks tomorrow with the international donors involved. </p><p>Today we agreed a second strategic partnership on sustainable agriculture and food security. </p><p> It's the next step in our framework for long-term bilateral cooperation. </p><p> We believe that sustainability is key to future economic success. </p><p> So the Dutch businesses here today are all committed to complying with international standards. </p><p> In recent years your country has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty. </p><p> This paves the way for new goals to promote the ongoing international integration of the Vietnamese economy. </p><p> And let me assure you that the Netherlands will remain committed to Vietnam's sustainable development.</p><p>I'm confident Vietnam will continue to open up through economic and political reforms. </p><p> Because that's essential to remain competitive. </p><p> We admire your efforts to reform the state-owned sector, promote public-private partnerships and fight red tape and corruption. </p><p> But it's a hard job and major challenges remain. </p><p> The Netherlands stands ready to support you wherever we can. </p><p> The EU-Vietnam Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Vietnam will be very important in this respect. </p><p> Not only will they boost trade and investment, to our mutual benefit. </p><p> They will also help generate support for your reforms. </p><p> The deadline for signing the Free Trade Agreement is ambitious, but I understand that both sides are keen to finalise it this year.</p><p>Prime Minister Dung, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, Vietnam will remain a top priority country, both for the Dutch government and the Dutch business community. </p><p> Together we will move forward, building on firm foundations of bilateral cooperation and friendship.</p><p>So now let me propose a toast. </p><p> To the friendship between the Vietnamese and Dutch peoples. </p><p> To successful partnerships between our businesses. </p><p> And to the future of your beautiful country, whose fantastic hospitality I have now experienced for myself.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",4
64,"<p>Your Majesties, </p><p> Your Royal Highness, </p><p> Secretary of State Arif, </p><p> Your Excellencies, </p><p> esteemed veterans, </p><p> ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>General Eisenhower once said that 'in the final choice a soldier's pack is not so heavy a burden as a prisoner's chains'. </p><p> And 70 years ago, that choice was there to be made. </p><p> D-Day, 6 June 1944, was a decisive moment in world history. </p><p> A day which millions of people throughout Europe had been fervently wishing for. </p><p> A day of hope. </p><p> After a long and dark period of oppression and persecution, without freedom or justice, suddenly there was the promise of regained liberty. </p><p> At last. </p><p> The feeling must have been indescribable.</p><p>We are on historic ground today. </p><p> This is where it all happened. </p><p> 'Never had there been a dawn like this,' Cornelius Ryan wrote in his bestselling book The Longest Day. </p><p> And today, in the presence of the heroes of those days, history becomes tangible. </p><p> If we look out to sea, we might imagine we can see them. </p><p> The thousands of vessels, gathered off the French coast during the night. </p><p> In our minds, we can hear the throbbing engines of the endless procession of bombers, high up in the clouds, providing air support. </p><p> And we try to imagine the thoughts of the 200,000 Allied soldiers, who know they are about to put themselves in mortal danger. </p><p> Especially that first group of several thousand men, getting ready to storm the beaches. </p><p> Tense in every sinew of their bodies, but also determined to vanquish the enemy. </p><p>Many of them made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. </p><p> Today is a day for us to pay tribute to them. </p><p> We are, and always will be, grateful to all our liberators. </p><p> We are grateful to the Maquis, the brave men and women of the French resistance, who disrupted the war machines of the Nazis behind the lines. </p><p> And veterans, we are grateful to you. </p><p> For while in the history of mankind, freedom has seldom been received as a gift, rarely has it been gained at so high a cost.</p><p>D-Day was the beginning. </p><p> Freedom fanned out over Europe from the Normandy beaches. </p><p> But unfortunately not without a fight. </p><p> The final victory was still almost a year away. </p><p> A year of unimaginable destruction and innumerable casualties. </p><p> But also a year in which heroes stood up and evil was driven back step by step. </p><p> Until peace and freedom were established.</p><p>Lieux de mémoire</p><p>, as our French hosts say, are being created at more and more sites of memorable events in that period. </p><p> Places of remembrance along the Routes of Liberation. </p><p> A Dutch initiative to this end has been taken up and is spreading to different countries. </p><p> That is important, because we need to continue to tell the stories of our liberation. </p><p> And not only the epic story of Operation Overlord. </p><p> But the smaller, more personal stories too. </p><p> That way, we keep the memories of the fallen alive. </p><p> That way, we do justice to the bravery and courage shown by you, our Dutch veterans, and all Allied veterans. </p><p> And that way, we can pass on the value of freedom to new generations. This is a continuing mission, for we must never take freedom for granted. </p><p> In that sense, it will still be D-Day tomorrow, the day after and all the days that follow.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>In his famous 'letter to the troops', the order of the day for 6 June 1944, General Eisenhower marked the significance of D-Day in powerful terms. </p><p> 'The tide has turned! </p><p> The free men of the world are marching together to Victory!' </p><p> (…) </p><p> 'We will accept nothing less than full Victory!'</p><p>Today, 70 years on, those words have lost none of their strength. </p><p> On the contrary, they have gained in significance. </p><p> For the choice that was made then, the choice to restore freedom and human dignity, without compromise, must be our choice too. </p><p> Again and again. </p><p> Every single day.</p>",0
65,"<p>Your Majesties, </p><p> Your Royal Highnesses, </p><p> Distinguished laureates, </p><p> Mr King's Commissioner, </p><p> Members of the Roosevelt family, </p><p> Your Excellencies, </p><p> ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>The four freedoms that we honour today are fundamental and universal. </p><p> They apply to everyone, everywhere, at all times. </p><p> At least, that's how it should be. </p><p> Sadly, in reality, it depends on where and when you were born.</p><p>In our part of Europe we will soon be commemorating the 70th anniversary of D-Day, 6 June 1944. </p><p> A date recorded in golden letters in the book of freedom and the rule of law. </p><p> A special date here, too, in Zeeland, the scene of the Battle of the Scheldt, one of the most brutal clashes of the Second World War. </p><p> We now live in freedom thanks to the sacrifice and courage of the allied heroes, for which we are forever grateful.</p><p>But this is our reality. </p><p> Only a few hundred kilometres to the east, the liberation was short-lived. </p><p> True freedom only came within reach decades later. </p><p> On 6 November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, changing the lives of millions behind the Iron Curtain. </p><p> This year we also mark that historic moment 25 years ago.</p><p>And we do so knowing that the four freedoms which President Franklin D. Roosevelt said were essential to human dignity are still not part of everyone's daily reality. </p><p> In the history of mankind, freedom is almost never a gift. </p><p> It must be fought for by people and organisations with the courage to stand up for their principles and convictions, even in the face of great difficulty. </p><p> Like today's winners of the Four Freedoms Award and all the laureates before them. </p><p> They deserve our highest praise and deepest respect.</p><p>I've noticed that the stories of most of the Four Freedoms laureates are about the future. </p><p> About freedom and legal certainty as conditions for progress for people, countries and regions. </p><p> We will hear more of their stories today. </p><p> Stories about education and opportunities for development. </p><p> About health and wellbeing for all. </p><p> About building a democratic and peaceful society, where everyone feels safe and has economic security. </p><p> All of these concepts are linked. </p><p> Or as President Roosevelt said: </p><p> 'True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.'</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, in 1940 President Roosevelt called the Netherlands 'a great democracy' and 'one of the earliest of all the democracies in the world'. </p><p> His praise was a testimony to the special relationship between the United States and our country. </p><p> A bond that was also reflected in the close personal friendship he and his wife Eleanor had with members of our Royal House.</p><p>In the Netherlands, we cherish this transatlantic friendship and we're proud that the presentation of the Four Freedoms Awards has had a Dutch tint from the beginning. </p><p> Since the days of Hugo Grotius, our country has been known worldwide as a firm advocate for the rule of law and a centre of international law and international security. </p><p> And we are committed to actively fulfilling that role, as we recently did when we proudly hosted the Nuclear Security Summit.</p><p>In his famous State of the Union address of 6 January 1941, President Roosevelt said: </p><p> 'Freedom means the supremacy of human rights everywhere. Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights or keep them. Our strength is our unity of purpose.' </p><p> These words still inspire us today. </p><p> Like you, today's laureates, who put them into practice with your actions and make a difference for countless others. </p><p> Today, your exceptional efforts are being justly recognised. </p><p> And today your message of hope will be heard round the world.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",2
66,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Welcome to the Netherlands, and welcome to The Hague, international city of peace and justice.</p><p>As you may know, the Peace Palace, which celebrated its centenary a few months ago, is only a short walk from this convention centre. Over the past hundred years the Peace Palace has become the symbol of efforts to create a stable world order by means of international cooperation. And that is exactly what is driving our efforts to make this third Nuclear Security Summit a success. All our discussions today and tomorrow will focus on one question: how to prevent nuclear terrorism?Or to be more precise: how can we make sure that nuclear materials won't end up in the hands of terrorists and that nuclear material is used more efficiently and stored more securely.</p><p>President Obama, you are personally responsible for getting this issue on the international agenda. The first Nuclear Security Summit in 2010, and the Washington Work Plan that it produced, still guide our efforts today. You laid the foundations, and so the world is in your debt.</p><p>President Park, two years ago your country hosted the second NSS, where we noted the progress we had made and raised our ambitions. And with success, because looking back on the past two years, we can see that real progress has been made. Not only have diplomatic efforts moved forward and documents been adopted, but there have also been quantifiable results. For example, since the process began the number of countries with more than a kilogram of usable highly enriched uranium has fallen substantially. This shows that we set off in the right direction four years ago in Washington, and that the summit in Seoul was also productive.</p><p>But we cannot rest on our laurels. We have to raise our ambitions again. We have to aim even higher here in The Hague. Because even as we speak, there are still almost 2,000 tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material in circulation worldwide. And its security has to be our constant concern.</p><p>We know how little material is needed to make a crude nuclear bomb. We know that the technologies  required to make such a bomb are spreading. And we know - especially since 9/11 - that unscrupulous terrorists will not hesitate to use any weapon they can get their hands on. So the need to take steps to prevent nuclear terrorism is growing more urgent, not less.</p><p>The task we took on four years ago is not an easy one. But perhaps working for a safe, stable world is never easy. As Dag Hammarskjöld once said, 'The pursuit of peace and progress, with its trials and its errors, its successes and its setbacks, can never be relaxed and never abandoned.' And he was right. There is no magic formula we can use to free the world once and for all from the menace of nuclear terrorism. </p><p> And sitting back and doing nothing is not an option. But we are making progress, step by step.</p><p>There are three main goals we need to stay focused on at this summit and afterwards.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>A great deal of advance work has been done in the run-up to this Nuclear Security Summit. Today and tomorrow we will hone our common objectives and set our course for the years ahead. The long-running debate on improving the security of nuclear material has been like running a marathon. Every now and then we make a dash forwards. This time we are making a dash in The Hague. We will make another in 2016 at the next summit in the US - on our way to embed nuclear security firmly in national, regional and global institutions and procedures.</p><p>Your presence here today underscores once more your countries' political commitment to this goal. This should give us confidence that we will succeed. The task we took on in 2010 demands resolve, and perhaps more patience than we would like. But in the words of Nelson Mandela, whose statue stands outside, close by: 'It always seems impossible until it's done.' Let us press on in that conviction - today, tomorrow and in the days that follow - towards our goal of a safer world.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p>",0
67,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Netherlands, welcome to Amsterdam, and welcome to this special location.</p><p>We're standing here on historic ground - surrounded by the finest paintings that Holland has produced and only a stone's throw from the house of John Adams, the first American ambassador to the Netherlands and second president of the United States. It's a location that symbolises the enduring partnership between the US and the Netherlands. Our shared history and heritage go back a long way. </p><p>As a historian, it was a very special moment for me when, earlier today, I was able to show President Obama two original documents from our National Archives that played an important role in the age-old friendship between our two countries. The first was our own 'Declaration of Independence', the Plakkaat van Verlatinghe of 1581, which inspired Thomas Jefferson and his peers. The second was the American-Dutch Treaty of Amity and Trust of 1782 - another remarkable document from an age when peace between countries was usually a hard-fought affair.</p><p>And today, friendship is still at the heart of the relationship between the United States and the Netherlands, along with trade, shared values and joint responsibilities. Since that first treaty we have worked together in the growing awareness that economic prosperity, a safe and stable world and international cooperation go hand in hand.</p><p>With this in mind, the President and I talked about a wide range of subjects. Starting with joint climate initiatives and the new steps we will take today in that regard. The Netherlands is joining with the United States and a group of other countries in a bid to stop international public funding of new coal-fired power plants, for example by multilateral development banks. We want to achieve an international level playing field, to ensure that private and public parties invest in green growth wherever possible.</p><p>We also discussed the important topic of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement between the EU and the US. Once concluded, this agreement will create more economic growth and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. Importantly, it will set new standards that will benefit global trade and third countries as well. This partnership will bolster our excellent bilateral economic ties even further. During our conversation I stressed how much we value this partnership. The Netherlands is the world's third largest investor in the United States, and we are home to some 1800 American businesses. </p><p>And of course we also spoke about the major international security issues in Syria, Iran and the Ukraine. Concerning the latter, we both regard Russia's attempts to annex the Crimea as a flagrant breach of international law, and we condemn its actions in the strongest possible terms. The presence of so many world leaders in the Netherlands this week presents an important opportunity for the international community to discuss this subject as well as other pressing issues that affect our common interests.</p><p>Finally, we looked ahead to the Nuclear Security Summit today and tomorrow. President Obama deserves all the credit for getting this topic high on the agenda. In 2010, Washington hosted the first summit on this theme. In 2012, it was Seoul's turn. And now the Netherlands is proud to host a summit, today and tomorrow in The Hague, that will bring us closer to the goal of securing potentially dangerous nuclear material. Your presence, Barack, underlines the importance of the summit. And this event, too, demonstrates the strength of the bilateral ties between our countries, and of our joint commitment to peace, security and democracy. I am delighted to be able to reaffirm that publicly, here at this splendid location.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
68,"<p>Welcome to The Hague and the Nuclear Security Summit. We're proud to be the organisers of this Summit, it is the largest conference ever held in NL. A summit devoted to an important topic. The issues we'll be addressing over the next few days impact on the security of all the people of the world. The chance that nuclear or radioactive material could fall into the hands of terrorists is small, fortunately. But if it were to happen, the consequences could be enormous. We need to do everything we can to prevent nuclear terrorism. We have gathered here with that clear aim.</p><p>Nuclear material has many good uses. It can generate energy, and in hospitals, medical isotopes help fight cancer. But if it fell into the wrong hands, nuclear material could also be used to make a nuclear weapon. And malicious people could use radioactive material to make a dirty bomb, causing massive social disruption. President Obama put this issue on the global agenda in 2009. I endorse his view that nuclear terrorism is one of the greatest threats to international security. All the more so since there are relatively few binding international agreements in this area. We have universally binding agreements on medication, food safety and aviation security, to name only three areas. When it comes to nuclear security, we can definitely do better.</p><p>So what are the goals of this Summit? We seek to reduce the chance that nuclear or radioactive material could fall into the hands of terrorists, in various ways:</p><p>A great deal has already happened, thanks to the previous Summits in Washington and Seoul. But we have to be honest: it's not nearly enough. In 2013, 146 incidents involving nuclear and radioactive material were reported to the IAEA. Most of these related to material that had temporarily gone missing, but the possibility of a serious incident continues to hang over us.</p><p>My ambition as chair of this NSS is to raise the bar even higher and boost the security of our people even more. The groundwork for this has already been laid by negotiating teams of the participating countries. To use a football metaphor, the ball is already on the penalty spot. But now it's up to the leaders to kick it into the goal. This is what we're here to do over the next few days.</p><p>We've worked hard to put together an innovative programme for this summit. Countries will still issue national statements, but a number of them will present their standpoints in the form of video statements. There will also be an informal session, for the heads of delegation only, where we'll talk about the future of the NSS process. We will also have an interactive policy discussion about the national and international response to an incident involving nuclear terrorism. And finally, on Tuesday you will read the final communiqué of this paperless summit with the help of the NSS app on your tablet or smartphone.</p><p>Big international conferences like the NSS are often a good opportunity to discuss current affairs in the margins. Ukraine is one of these current issues right now. And several leaders will take advantage of their presence here to talk about pressing issues outside the direct scope of the NSS.</p><p>I conclude. Enhancing nuclear security is a complicated process. But kilo by kilo, we're reducing the amount of nuclear material, and step by step, we're improving security measures. Here, against the fitting backdrop of The Hague, the city of peace and justice, we will move forward, making the world a bit safer.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
69,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Let me start by telling you about Dave Hakkens, a young Dutchman who graduated last year from the Design Academy in Eindhoven. His project attracted attention all over the world. For years, he had wondered why we throw our smartphones away every couple of years, while we're happy to repair our bikes ourselves. He hated the amount of e-waste created each year, so he thought up the 'Phonebloks' concept: a modular phone that works like Lego. All its parts - camera, GPS, memory, battery - can be fitted by the user. So if one component breaks, you simply order a new block online.</p><p>Dave's YouTube film got millions of views in only a few weeks. In no time, he had almost a million supporters online. The story was picked up by the media and the idea soon got the attention of several big companies. Then things really started moving. The latest news, from two weeks ago, is that Google plans to release the phone in early 2015. Some people are already calling it the 'iPhone killer'.</p><p>Stories like this show what the modern economy is all about. Creativity. Ambition. Smart use of new technology. And the power of online and social media. It's also about having an international outlook. Dave Hakkens is of course a classic example of the brilliant solo entrepreneur. But equally innovative were the 300 researchers from 14 EU countries who in 2012 made the cover of the journal Nature. Led by Wageningen University, they mapped the complete DNA of the tomato, one of my country's leading exports. And there's no shortage of innovation in the projects and partnerships on display at this second European Innovation Convention. Every story, every product, idea and application is unique. But together they underline how essential it is that we create space for innovation at every level. And in Europe in particular. </p><p> We all understand why this is so important. Although the European economy is recovering, unemployment is still high. Alarmingly high in some countries, especially among young people. Reason enough to seek out new prospects for growth and development. And it's great to see that the spending programmes in the new EU budget are far more focused on that goal than in the past.</p><p>But that is not enough. The world is changing. We are at a crossroads, as President Obama noted in his recent State of the Union address. He said, 'We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow.' This may pose a bigger challenge to Europe than America. Because while Europe has a strong track record in high-value creative concepts, it can also be a little too conservative when it comes to entrepreneurship and personal risk. But today's economy demands dynamic growth. We can't allow Europe's economic place in the global village to become a neighbourhood of grand but crumbling mansions, without funds for maintenance and new developments. </p><p> In short, what we need is economic innovation. Real innovation. We need to give people like Dave Hakkens the space they need to succeed. Or a helping hand, if they need one. We have to create a climate for innovation that encourages companies and research centres. One that helps them get the best out of themselves and each other. That is why this conference is so important. That is why the 'Innovation Union' is such an exciting prospect. Because an EU that is fully geared to new knowledge and technology offers enormous potential in three key ways: promoting economic growth, creating jobs and finding solutions to major challenges like demographic aging and energy security.</p><p>For me it is an honour to stand here today representing a country with a long tradition of innovation. For the Netherlands is a true innovator: from the pumping stations we used back in the seventeenth century to reclaim land from the sea, to the energy-saving LEDs produced by Philips, which light up the Eiffel Tower at night. A major recent study by the Financial Times confirmed that view, naming Eindhoven Europe's third-most innovative city. Three of the top-ten most innovative regions are in the Netherlands. And tomorrow Groningen will be competing for the title of 'European Capital of Innovation'. As you might imagine, we're proud of this recognition, and we see it as confirmation that we're on the right path.</p><p>But what kind of path is it, exactly? I'd like to explain, briefly. In the Netherlands, we've designed our innovation policy with three principles in mind. </p><p>First, we concentrate on areas where we already excel. We call these our 'top sectors'. So we made a conscious choice to promote excellence in fields like water, agri-food and life sciences. These are the areas where we want to compete globally. In fact, we want to be the world number one.</p><p>Second, it is not the government alone that decides the innovation agenda. We work with relevant companies and the research community. We call this model the 'triple helix'. So the government's main role is not as a grant office, but as a network partner and enabling force. We work to reduce the regulatory burden, for example. We have an active agenda for our foreign missions, aimed at bolstering international knowledge networks. And we've started a revolving innovation fund, in which a one-off investment of taxpayers' money provides continual funding for new projects. The goal of this approach is to unlock maximum energy and activity in the top sectors. But does this concept of shared responsibility work? You only have to look at total public and private R&D spending in 2012 which, in a tough economic time, rose by over 6.5 per cent to almost 13 billion euros. </p><p> A third choice we always make in the Netherlands is to align very closely with European innovation programmes. New knowledge and its applications have little regard for national borders, and the feasibility of many projects depends on their scale. What's more, experience shows that international cooperation nearly always benefits everyone concerned. Some 1,200 Dutch companies and research organisations are now involved in European innovation projects. I'm sure that Horizon 2020, which was launched recently is an important next step. Across the EU, thousands of enterprises and institutions and tens of thousands of people are involved, including top researchers from around the world. </p><p> Nearly 80 billion euros will be invested in Horizon 2020 by the end of this decade. This means that the EU as a whole is engaged in the biggest research programme in the world. And let's not forget the underlying goals: boosting Europe's GDP by 800 billion euros and creating 3.7 million new jobs. These figures speak for themselves. There's no lack of ambition.</p><p>I applaud these efforts. But so much ambition entails obligations, of course. And I am absolutely convinced that the Innovation Union must be more than simply a large sum of money and a series of research projects. The Innovation Union itself needs to be innovative, by working always to create the very best conditions for innovation in the academic and business worlds. Funds and programmes are of course crucial, but so much more can be done. Here are some examples.</p><p>First, there is the perennial problem of red tape - excessive rules that stifle initiative, including innovation. While the lifeblood of innovation is freedom. Freedom to experiment. Freedom to think outside the box. Freedom to fail and then try again. And freedom to work with whomever you want. So the ongoing battle against red tape also benefits innovation policy. We must at least get rid of the remaining obstacles to the free movement of knowledge and researchers. The European patent, too, is coming ever closer. It doesn't require specialist knowledge, merely political and administrative will.</p><p>A firm political and administrative commitment to knowledge circulation and open data is essential. Because knowledge only becomes truly useful if enough people and organisations have access to it. Public authorities, companies and research institutions are sitting on a wealth of research information that is relevant to many people but often accessible to very few. Even though much of the underlying research is funded with taxpayers' money. So a genuine Innovation Union will promote open access to academic publications and government data. Maximum knowledge for the maximum number of people - that should be our goal. And it will receive the Netherlands' wholehearted support.</p><p>Another well-known requirement is to bolster the internal market and fully implement the Services Directive. This will directly benefit new and innovative business sectors like the gaming industry and online media companies. Services account for 80 per cent of the Dutch economy, but only 20 per cent of our exports - something that is very difficult to explain. Giving these companies more room to spread their wings will boost the innovative capacity of Europe as a whole. This, too, demands resolve.</p><p>A third example concerns the current debate on the division of tasks between the European Commission and the member states. At what level can tasks best be carried out? What changes are needed to make European governance leaner and meaner, and safeguard its future effectiveness? The question of effectiveness is also relevant to innovation. It is mainly up to the member states to ensure that their economies are competitive and that their knowledge infrastructure is in order. Only then will the whole be more than the sum of the parts in Europe. In other words: European innovation programmes must not compensate for national shortcomings, but give the innovation efforts of member states added value.</p><p>This added value mainly comes from increases in scale and from connecting knowledge and people, producing results that a single country or research group could not achieve so quickly, if at all. A topical example is the bio-based economy. Everyone understands that it can only be achieved if countries and sectors work together. For instance, a group of international researchers led by the Dutch firm, Avantium, has developed a biodegradable plastic bottle that Coca-Cola wants to use for its drinks.</p><p>Another example is the concept of 'smart cities', which is of course very appealing to a densely populated country like the Netherlands. But don't forget that two-thirds of all Europeans now live and work in metropolitan regions. And all these regions face similar challenges in areas like transport, logistics, energy, health and the living environment. More and more, the challenge is to unite all these interests, and this demands an innovative approach. Working together on the Urban Agenda has already shown its potential. And when it comes to heating our homes more cleanly, a group of 16 European parties led by the Dutch Energy Research Centre has developed a new global standard for silicon solar panels that are more efficient than ever before.</p><p>Finally, let me mention the digital agenda of my compatriot, Commissioner Neelie Kroes. Its roll-out is important, not only because it can potentially create 3.8 million new jobs, but also because it will make it easier for companies and researchers to exchange large quantities of information. And speaking of making life easier: I don't know about you, but when I travel from one European country to another, nothing really changes, except in the most advanced device I carry with me: my smartphone. Apps that suddenly become very sluggish, the well-known problem of roaming costs - these are fairly minor but irritating and unnecessary barriers. And these too could be eliminated by the digital agenda.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>The late Steve Jobs, one of the most innovative thinkers of our time, summed it up well: 'Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.' Given its position, the EU has a duty to lead the way. And this demands a constant focus on innovation. In everything we do. For innovation is not a list of projects or telephone numbers. It is a mind-set and a must. And I promise you that during the Dutch Presidency in 2016, we will give this issue the attention it deserves.</p><p>I wish you all an inspiring, informative and successful convention.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",10
70,"<p>Mr Schulz, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>In September 1944, a Dutchwoman, Kate ter Horst, witnessed the Allied parachute landings from her home in Oosterbeek, near Arnhem. The drone of aircraft engines and the image of hundreds of paratroopers floating to the ground made her heart soar. After years of war and occupation, freedom beckoned. At last.</p><p>It was an overwhelming feeling, which Kate described in her diary like this: </p><p>‘Mad with joy we walk through the garden and climb up on the roof so we can see more, grasp more of what’s happening. We can hardly believe it. Can it really be true? Is this the long-awaited end to our sorrows, falling from the sky? Does this mean freedom?’</p><p>Those words show conflicting emotions: euphoria, certainly, but also disbelief and uncertainty. And with good reason, it turned out, as Operation Market Garden stalled in Arnhem. Liberation took many more months of fighting and destruction, and came only at the cost of countless more young lives.</p><p>During the Battle of Arnhem Kate ter Horst made a real difference. She set up an aid station in her home, and in no time its rooms were filled with wounded British servicemen. Kate had a cheerful word and a sympathetic ear for each of them. Her reading of Psalm 91 brought particular comfort to her young guests, if only because of that one, moving line: ‘For he will give you into the care of angels, to keep you wherever you go.’ To those British veterans Kate ter Horst would always remain the ‘Angel of Arnhem’, bringing light to the darkness. Her story is told at the exhibition that opens here today. And I welcome her daughter Sophie, who is with us to mark this occasion.</p><p>Kates’ story is a remarkable one. But it’s only one of countless personal stories of Europeans who saw liberation at first hand. Often their stories are as unique as Kate ter Horst’s. But they all have one thing in common: a powerful longing for freedom. A universal longing felt across Europe at that time. We all know how history played out, of course. For some, liberation meant simply waving in the streets as columns of allied troops marched by.</p><p>Others, like Kate ter Horst, had to survive for months on the front lines. Large parts of the southern Netherlands had been free and safe for months while people in the north faced a winter of hunger and want. More than twenty thousand people starved to death. And on a European scale the differences were just as extreme. While the West celebrated freedom in the spring of 1945, the Iron Curtain of oppression soon descended on the East. Freedom vanished once more. </p><p>Which brings me to the key significance of this exhibition. Because the European ‘routes of liberation’ bridge these differences. They are routes that unite us, both literally and metaphorically. They create a bond between countries and regions that each perceive and commemorate the Second World War from their own historical perspective. They create a bond between us and those who lived through the war: our parents and grandparents, who suffered and fought for our freedom. And they also create a bond between us and our liberators, the Allied forces, many of whom made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>The words Sir Winston Churchill used to describe the men of the First Airborne Division, who fought in Arnhem, apply to every soldier – regardless of his nationality – who fought to liberate Europe. He said, and I quote:</p><p>‘In attack most daring, in defence most cunning, in endurance most steadfast, they performed a feat of arms which will be remembered and recounted as long as the virtues of courage and resolution have power to move the hearts of men.’ </p><p>We must never forget their sacrifice for our freedom.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen</p><p>The post-war history of Europe is a story of peace. Of old foes becoming friends. Of countries working together more and more closely. Of disappearing boundaries between people, both physical and metaphorical. It’s a story of rising prosperity and shared economic challenges. But above all it’s a story about the dream of freedom. A dream that has come true for almost all Europeans since the fall of the Berlin Wall. This post-war story has also brought us ever closer to the point where we can come together to reflect on the horrors of the Second World War.</p><p>I’m proud of this Dutch initiative. And I’m proud that seventy years after D-Day there is so much support ¬for it in other European countries. It means that this exhibition on the ‘Routes of Liberation’ says as much about the present and our common European future as it does about our past. We can trace a direct line from Liberation to the free and democratic European elections that will be held on 22 May. So it is not merely symbolic that both the European Parliament and its president have had such a visible, galvanising role in this initiative.</p><p>Thank you, Mr Schulz.</p><p>In closing, I’d like to take you back to the home of Kate ter Horst in Oosterbeek.</p><p>It is still the autumn of 1944. In her diary, she writes about two soldiers who stood lookout for three days in the village church while under sustained attack by enemy forces. The soldiers escaped by the skin of their teeth and later described their ordeal to Kate:</p><p>‘Their eyes,’ she wrote, ‘are filled with horror at the fate they themselves escaped. How many comrades did they have to leave behind? And what Providence will sustain them in the hours, days and nights to come? […] The guns surround us like a ring of iron. They seem to approach by command, slowly but surely. The fighting swells into an orgy of demonic violence. The air and space around us are a living hell. There’s nothing more to say. Together we sit frozen, full of dread, and silent.’</p><p>That deafening silence, ladies and gentlemen, is something we must continue to hear and continue to break through. By never forgetting. By continuing to commemorate the victims of a war that almost destroyed Europe. And by defending freedom with all our might. Not just our own freedom, but that of others too. </p><p>The Routes of Liberation will show us the way.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",1
71,"<p>Prime Minister Netanyahu, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>When you visited the Netherlands last year, Mr Netanyahu, you were asked what quality best described the relationship between our two countries. Your answer was: ‘familiarity’. It is a word with several meanings, but they all imply a sense of warmth. Familiarity means affinity, friendship and affection. It means you know each other so well, like an old married couple. It means you’ve experienced a lot together.</p><p>In short, it says something about the natural – and at the same time emotional – bond between the Netherlands and Israel. I really felt that bond this morning when I visited Yad Vashem. This impressive memorial also commemorates the many Dutch Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. What’s more, Yad Vashem honours 5,269 Dutch nationals as ‘Righteous Among the Nations’, for their efforts to help the Jews in their hour of need. That figure will soon be 5,270, when diplomat Joseph Kolkman is awarded the decoration posthumously. Kolkman helped persecuted Jews when he was the Dutch Vice Consul in Perpignan. </p><p>Our peoples share a common mentality, and a culture of openness. The Dutch and Israelis don’t beat about the bush. We say precisely what we mean. And we can be headstrong too. Some years ago, a diplomat at the Israeli embassy in The Hague put it this way: It doesn’t matter where you are in the world; if you see someone crossing the street when the light is red, you can bet they are either Dutch or Israeli.</p><p>These shared qualities make doing business together easy. When you’re closing a deal, it helps if you can relate to each other. The figures speak for themselves. In 2012 trade between us reached an all-time high of five billion dollars. We are Israel’s second-biggest European export destination. Thanks to the port of Rotterdam, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport and our outstanding logistics, the Netherlands offers excellent access to the rest of Europe.</p><p>Both Israel and the Netherlands have suffered stagnation in their exports as a result of the crisis. But even so, the Israeli economy is expected to grow by an impressive 3.7 per cent in 2013. Fortunately the Netherlands is now also recovering.</p><p>So when it comes to trade between our countries, the only way is up! That’s why now is the time to enhance our cooperation. And that’s why I’m so pleased that Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have just signed a joint statement launching this cooperation forum between the Netherlands and Israel. It brings together companies, knowledge institutions, civil society organisations and government authorities. First, to generate ideas together. And then to make them happen. Tacheles, as you say. In this way, the forum will enhance the competitive position of both countries. That’s crucial in a time of rising globalisation. And it’s why more than seventy companies have travelled here with me. They represent the best of what the Netherlands has to offer in sectors like water management, energy and gas, agri-food, life sciences and health, and high tech. It’s obvious why these companies are so keen to work with Israel. This is the ultimate start-up nation.</p><p>In relative terms, no other country invests as much in research. Google and Samsung come here to find inspiration for new products. According to Google chairman Eric Schmidt: after the US, Israel is the world’s most important centre for high-tech. And there are other sectors where Israel’s creativity is second to none. Your pioneering spirit is perfectly in keeping with the Netherlands’ culture of enterprise. My country has always been good at consolidating successful companies and helping them grow. What’s more, we have a very highly educated population and a tradition of innovation. And of course, the Netherlands is the gateway to Europe and the wider world. That means big opportunities to work together in targeting other countries.</p><p>All in all, we’re a match made in heaven! Consider what happened recently at the Schneider Children’s Medical Center in Petach Tikva. There, Israeli start-up RealView Imaging teamed up with Dutch multinational Philips to test a new technology that can provide 3-D holographic imaging during operations. Surgeons at the hospital were able to view and manipulate a 3-D image of the heart they were working on. This revolutionary system will have major implications for the future of medical science. That’s what can happen when the smartest people from our two countries put their heads together.</p><p>Prime Minister Netanyahu, today we of course talked about the situation in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean, the tensions in the region, developments in Iran and the importance of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian question. I expressed my admiration for the leadership and courage displayed on both sides with respect to reopening the peace talks and getting all outstanding issues on the table. This presents a historic opportunity to move forward. This will be good for Israel and for its relationships with the Arab region, Europe and the wider world. And it offers the prospect of a future in which Israel and the Palestinians can live side-by-side in peace, prosperity and security. In two democratic states based on the 1967 borders, with mutually agreed land swaps. </p><p>I am sure that my visit today, with its many meetings and discussions between Dutch and Israeli business leaders and researchers, will lead to all kinds of fine initiatives and partnerships. Israel’s pioneering spirit and our shared innovative tradition and business mentality provide some very fertile soil. Not to mention our warm, long-standing friendship, which ensures we never grow apart. Our mutual attraction is summed up neatly by the famous Dutch poet, Jacob Israël de Haan: He who in Amsterdam would cry “Jerusalem” And travelled there, a driven man, Still muses on that other land, “Amsterdam, Amsterdam”.</p><p>Prime Minister Netanyahu, thank you for your hospitality. I hope to welcome you to the Netherlands again soon. And I look forward to the next forum, in the Netherlands, in 2015.</p><p>I would like to propose a toast to lasting friendship, successful partnerships and exciting future opportunities.</p><p>Le chaim.</p>",1
72,"<p>Prime Minister Hamdallah, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Marhaban, my friends, anna mabsoet inni hòh. I’m delighted to be here. Thank you for making me feel so at home.</p><p>The great Edward Saïd, who was born in Jerusalem, once said that ‘(..) history is made by men and women, just as it can also be unmade and rewritten’. Saïd used his sharp intellect to give the world a more open view of the Arab world. He warned against inaccurate historical impressions of ‘the Orient’, as he called it. But these words also carry the inspiring message that history is in our own hands. So we can change it for the better. And that seems a fitting message for this first cooperation forum between the Palestinian territories and the Netherlands.</p><p>Because today we are writing the first words of a new chapter in the relations between our two peoples. Let us make it a story not of limitations and obstacles, but one of enterprise and initiative. A story of opportunities we can seize together. Of a successful common future.</p><p>Dutch involvement with the Palestinian people is already extensive. We work together closely in many areas, like food security, water management, judicial and governance capacity, and humanitarian aid for Palestinian refugees in the region. Last year we spent 54 million euros on these programmes alone.</p><p>So we can keep the introductions brief at this first cooperation forum. I’m happy to say that the economic ties between us are getting stronger, too. Our trade volumes may not yet be enormous, but they are growing at lightning speed. Direct Palestinian exports to the Netherlands have multiplied in recent years. And we are already one of the biggest export markets for Palestinian products in Europe. That shows how much potential there is. And it goes to the heart of this meeting and our joint plans for this forum. We can both gain a lot by stepping up our cooperation.</p><p>We have plenty to offer each other. The Palestinians are a highly educated and enterprising people. Business sectors like tourism and information technology are clearly on the rise here. And I can assure you that the Netherlands – your gateway to Europe – is no less enterprising. Our companies and knowledge institutions are world leaders in sectors like water, agri-food, energy and IT. These fields involve global challenges which are as relevant here as anywhere.</p><p>Consider the future supplies of water, energy and food. So it is no accident that these are the sectors represented at this first cooperation forum. The central question is: how can we use each other’s knowledge and know-how to innovate and achieve economic prosperity for our peoples?</p><p>And here’s an example of how valuable our bilateral ties can be. The ‘high-value crops project’ involves Palestinian farmers in Gaza and the West Bank. They are working with Dutch support to increase farming production and achieve certification so they can meet international market requirements. High-value crop exports are booming, and in the Jordan Valley there is scope for even more success.</p><p>Take the production of dates and fresh herbs and vegetables, both for neighbouring markets and the rest of the world. Another good example is the Dutch-Palestinian academic cooperation programme in the area of water. This will involve five Palestinian and five Dutch universities, collaborating on education, research and training.</p><p>The agreement underpinning this programme will be signed later this afternoon. So cooperation between Dutch and Palestinian partners is not only about money. The Dutch government firmly believes that prosperity, peace and security all feed into one another. The stronger the economy, the more people have the prospect of a successful future, for themselves and their children. And the bigger the chance of a peaceful solution to the serious problems which, sadly, the Palestinian people still face.</p><p>In my talks later today with President Abbas and Prime Minister Hamdallah, we will of course be discussing the situation in the Middle East, the tensions in the region and the importance of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian question. I would like to express my admiration for the leadership that was required on both sides to reopen the peace talks and get all outstanding issues on the table. This presents a historic opportunity to move forward. This will be good for Palestinians in the region, and for the relationship with Europe and the wider world. And it offers the prospect of a future in which Israel and the Palestinians can live side-by-side in peace, prosperity and security. In two democratic states based on the 1967 borders, with mutually agreed land swaps. </p><p>There is good reason to be optimistic. Because as the world-renowned Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish once said, ‘Palestinian people are in love with life.’ He knew that from experience. And we can see it in the dedication and energy of the people here. Of course, the perfect example of this ‘can-do’ mentality is Rawabi, a green city, unique in this region. It is equipped with the latest sustainable technologies. It has attracted a billion dollars in investment from all over the world, making it the biggest-ever construction project on Palestinian territory. And it is proof of the Palestinian people’s resilience and enterprising spirit.</p><p>All this makes the Netherlands eager to remain an active and dependable partner of the Palestinian people. My country’s government, businesses, universities and many other organisations want to join with the Palestinians and seize this chance to boost our economic ties. We want to share knowledge and support each other. And this cooperation forum provides a promising new instrument for doing that.</p><p>I would like to thank you, Prime Minister Hamdallah, for your hospitality and your support in setting up this forum. And I want to thank all of you for being here today and for your active participation in the forum. It means you see opportunities for enhancing our cooperation and for more shared economic success in the future.</p><p>I look forward to the results of this first forum and I wish you all an inspiring meeting. I hope it leads to bigger things. The next meeting, in 2015, will be held in the Netherlands. And we look forward to welcoming you.</p><p>Thank you. Shukrán lakum.</p>",5
73,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Selamat malam!</p><p>Welcome to the Borobudur Hotel and thank you for inviting me to say a few words before dinner. It’s good to see so many business leaders gathered here tonight. That says something about our countries’ mutual ambitions and the economic potential we see in each other.</p><p>Yesterday President Yudhoyono and I issued our Joint Declaration on a Comprehensive Partnership. This Declaration is what our visit is all about. And in fact, our detailed discussions today show that we’re already putting it into practice. In this document, the president and I reaffirm how vital and valuable we believe our relationship is. We state clearly that Indonesia and the Netherlands want to move forward together. That we have a lot to offer each other in economic, political and cultural terms. And that we see great opportunities ahead. In short: this document is all about a forward-looking relationship in which we can join forces and reap mutual benefits.</p><p>The Netherlands is already Indonesia’s second-biggest trading partner within the European Union. And thanks to the port of Rotterdam and Schiphol Airport, we are also Indonesia’s gateway to the rest of Europe. What’s more, for many years now the Netherlands has been the largest European investor in Indonesia.</p><p>But both Dutch and Indonesian businesses rightly see many more opportunities for cooperation. Last year, trade between our countries rose by no less than 18 per cent, defying the current global trend. That speaks for itself. It also explains why this is the biggest Dutch trade mission to Indonesia ever. I am joined by more than a hundred companies. Some have been doing business here for decades, and others want to get a foothold. But they all see opportunities and want to join forces. They represent business sectors in which the Dutch have always excelled. Sectors where our countries already work together closely, and where the future opportunities are biggest.</p><p>We also have a lot to offer each other in the international arena. The Netherlands can help steer Indonesia through the world of EU legislation and rules. In fact, we’re already doing so, for example with a training programme to help Indonesia comply with the EU’s air cargo safety regulations.</p><p>Indonesia likewise can help the Netherlands access the ASEAN market. Indonesia has the potential to become the world’s seventh-biggest economy by 2030. That says something about the impressive way the country has developed in recent years. In the Netherlands we’ve been watching this progress with great admiration. The global financial crisis seems to have passed Indonesia by. Year after year, it achieves growth figures of around six per cent. In Europe, the construction industry is suffering, but here skyscrapers are shooting up all the time. Car manufacturers and electronics firms are doing better than ever, thanks to the rising middle class. We have deep respect for these achievements. All this explains why Dutch businesses are so interested in Indonesia. We hope that by offering Dutch expertise in the sectors we excel in, we can contribute to Indonesia’s impressive economic development. There are good foundations for this type of cooperation.</p><p>For decades both countries have worked together closely in the area of flood protection. We are applying Dutch know-how in efforts to protect Jakarta from flooding. In the process we are also learning about the type of flood risks the Netherlands may face in the future. Our maritime industry, which includes companies like IHC Merwede, also has a lot to offer.</p><p>The same goes for the Dutch aviation industry, which is also represented in our trade mission, and is involved in several big projects at Indonesian airports. Take the Dutch company VanDerLande, which developed the baggage-handling system for Indonesia’s newest international airport at Medan, in North Sumatra.</p><p>Our mission also includes Dutch companies and research organisations in the area of agri-food, life sciences and health care.</p><p>They see plenty of scope for working with Indonesian partners on the many challenges Indonesia faces in developing its healthcare sector. The Dutch firm BMA, for example, has teamed up with partners here to develop a system for maternal pre-natal registration in Indonesia, which will help improve health care for pregnant women and newborn babies. During our visit there will be plenty of opportunity to make new contacts. Various participants will be concluding concrete agreements with their Indonesian counterparts at a signing ceremony later this evening. These agreements are based on cooperation geared to innovation. That’s something we certainly have in common. They involve large companies like Frisian Flag and East-West Seed, as well as the joint venture between Dutch firm Resin and its Indonesian partner Polymindo.</p><p>I hope that the days ahead will produce many more initiatives like these. I also hope that the Netherlands and Indonesia will continue to join forces as they have in the past, creating many fine plans for the future. Our countries share a special bond. A bond to cherish and to build on. That’s why we are here. </p><p>Terima Kasih. Thank you.</p>",4
74,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Thank you all for coming.</p><p>I’d like to begin with a few initial remarks about the important issue we are going to talk about today. Here are three facts that show its importance:</p><p>Experts predict that the figure will reach two billion by 2050. These facts lead to only one conclusion: sustainable growth, production and trade are not a choice, but a must. Not only for the Netherlands, but also for Indonesia, which is now the 16th biggest economy in the world and is actively seeking to promote its people’s prosperity. No country or business can achieve sustainability by itself. Global challenges demand global solutions and cooperation at every level. Horizontally, between countries and international organisations. And above all vertically, between governments, academics, businesses, consumer organisations and every other link in the chain. But I don’t think I need to convince you of that.</p><p>My message at the opening of this forum is a positive one. I believe that the momentum for sustainability is stronger than ever. And that is thanks to the way the market operates. More and more businesses, especially global players, have sustainability in their DNA. They feel a deep sense of responsibility for the coming generations and the future of our planet. In addition, consumers worldwide are recognising more and more that their behaviour can have an effect. </p><p>So corporate social responsibility is now far more than a marketing tool; it is a business case. To guarantee ongoing success, it needs to be reflected in everything a company does. When that idea reached the boardroom, the prospects for sustainable production and trade were enhanced further. Across the entire production chain, large international companies can now directly influence how their suppliers treat people and the environment. No government measure can match that.</p><p>So we are living at a time when the sustainability agendas of businesses, governments and civil society organisations are converging. A good example is the Tropical Forest Alliance, or TFA. This coalition involves several countries, including the Netherlands and Indonesia, and hundreds of big companies, including Coca Cola, Nestlé and – I’m proud to say – my own former employer, Unilever. The TFA is trying to combat deforestation by making the production of palm oil, paper and pulp, beef and soya more sustainable. And of course this can only be done by working with the main producers of these crops, like Indonesia. These efforts are proving successful, not least thanks to the personal involvement of President Yudhoyono. And this gives me confidence that the ultimate goal will be achieved – deforestation-free supply chains by 2020.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, sustainable production and trade are the way forward. They are a necessity and a business opportunity at the same time. So this forum is an another step in a process that will greatly benefit the world. I wish you all an enjoyable and inspiring meeting.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",1
75,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Selamat datang.</p><p>Welcome to the beautiful tropical gardens of the Borobudur Hotel. Let me begin by thanking our hosts, the Indonesian and Dutch Chambers of Commerce and employers’ associations. I’m delighted that so many people from the Indonesian and Dutch business communities could be here. That bodes well for this economic mission. And for the future economic ties between our two countries.</p><p>Because those economic ties are the main focus of this visit. Indonesia and the Netherlands share a long and eventful history. A history that has seen several ups and downs. But our past is something we share, and something that helps us face the future together. If I say anemer, bensin or kantor pos, both Dutch and Indonesian people will understand what I mean. But it is important not to get stuck in the past. The world is changing, and Indonesia is no exception. It has become a major global player, politically and economically. Its economy is growing by around six per cent a year, and it is a prominent member of the UN, the G20 and above all ASEAN.</p><p>We in the Netherlands admire these achievements. And Dutch companies are showing more and more interest in Indonesia. So it’s only logical that this is the biggest Dutch economic mission to Indonesia ever. With representatives of over a hundred companies from sectors where the Netherlands has always excelled. Sectors where we already work closely together and which offer the best opportunities for the future.</p><p>Horticulture, agri-food, life sciences and health, logistics and water.</p><p>Representatives of these sectors are here today. You’ve already met one another and exchanged ideas over the past two days. No doubt all sorts of plans are taking shape. May the discussions continue in the days ahead – and don’t forget to swap business cards! For this trip offers many opportunities. We can share knowledge and support each other. This is already happening on a large scale.</p><p>For example, I have seen how Dutch companies like Van Oord and Royal HaskoningDHV are working with Indonesian companies to develop the port of Jakarta. Very impressive – there’s no other way to describe it. Or take the Dutch company RESIN and its Indonesian partner Polymindo: they have developed a completely new, fire-retardant plastic based on non-toxic technology. And they are so pleased with the new material that they are now jointly introducing it on the Indonesian market.</p><p>Then there is East-West Seed, which supports innovation in the horticultural sector, and Frisian Flag, with its ‘dairy villages’ project, which is doing the same in the Indonesian dairy sector. So cooperation between our two countries is blossoming, even though they are thousands of kilometres apart.</p><p>I hope that many more ideas and contacts like this will develop during this trip. So that we can further deepen our special, long-standing relationship by making joint plans for the future.</p><p>Terima kasih, thank you.</p><p>Let us raise our glasses to the friendship between our countries, to new opportunities and to the Indonesian and Dutch business people who are seizing these opportunities.</p>",6
76,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>While preparing for this visit, I read an interview held last year with representatives of Indonesian and Dutch businesses. They were discussing our shared history, the close contact between us, and the companies that have been doing business together for decades. The article was in fact an appeal. An appeal to entrepreneurs to explore new markets and think out of the box.</p><p>From raising dairy cattle in the Indonesian countryside to growing orchids and selling Dutch croquettes! It even mentioned the arrival, in Jakarta, of FEBO, a well-known Dutch chain of snack bars. And it called for more exports of Dutch cheese, which I hear you like to sprinkle on your poffertjes over here! It was news to me that you eat poffertjes in Indonesia, too.</p><p>But this appeal is a highly relevant one, of course. We need to keep investing in each other and keep innovating.</p><p>That’s why it’s so good to be here. And it’s about time. The last time a Dutch prime minister visited Indonesia was in 2006, and we all know how important it is to meet face-to-face now and again. So I’m glad that many members of the Dutch government have visited recently. And that I was able to make this trip, together with the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, Lilianne Ploumen and the Minister for Agriculture, Sharon Dijksma. This helps us maintain and consolidate our close political, cultural and economic relations. With our sights set firmly on the future.</p><p>It’s ‘version 2.0’ of our relationship, to quote the Indonesian ambassador to the Netherlands, Mrs Retno Marsudi. And it’s important to look forward, because the world is changing, and Indonesia more than most. Your country is booming in many ways. It’s as if the global financial crisis doesn’t exist here. For years, Indonesia has been achieving annual growth of around six per cent. Figures we in Europe can only dream of.</p><p>Poverty is declining, and we now see an expanding middle class that is swelling the ranks of consumers with purchasing power. These changes are reflected in Indonesia’s rising prominence on the world stage. It is an active and significant player in the G20, the UN and, above all, ASEAN. And the end is not yet in sight.</p><p>Some experts believe that by 2030 Indonesia could be the world’s seventh-biggest economy. In the Netherlands we are watching this progress with admiration. And we hope we can use our knowledge and skills to contribute to Indonesia’s ongoing development.</p><p>Indonesia’s investment climate does present challenges. But it has a plan of action to attract foreign direct investment. The Netherlands is willing and able to help in this area. And our long-standing trade relations will stand us in good stead. The Netherlands and Indonesia can skip the introductions. Frisian Flag, which is here today, has been based in Jakarta since 1922. So it’s almost time for a centennial party! The company doesn’t simply make high-quality dairy products that are popular with Indonesian consumers. For many decades it has also been providing jobs and passing down valuable expertise about dairy technologies. In all, there are some 150 Dutch companies with branches in Indonesia. A big delegation is present today.</p><p>I am here with more than a hundred companies, the biggest trade mission to Indonesia ever. That certainly says something about our ambitions for this visit. Our two countries enjoy outstanding trade relations. We are already Indonesia’s biggest European investor, and its second-biggest European trading partner. Last year, Dutch imports from Indonesia were worth 2.8 billion euros and exports to Indonesia 628 million euros. We are Indonesia’s main export destination in Europe. And the port of Rotterdam and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport are Indonesia’s gateway to the rest of Europe.</p><p>But, of course, we can do even better. Fortunately, other Dutch companies are also discovering the Indonesian market. Last year, trade between our countries rose by no less than 18 per cent, defying all current trends. Many of those interested companies are here with us today. They mostly come from sectors in which the Netherlands excels. Like agri-food and horticulture, water, life sciences and health, and ports and logistics.</p><p>Of course, we want to maintain and consolidate our leading position in these sectors. Our watchwords are knowledge, innovation and collaboration. Because sharing knowledge and learning from others is the only way to move forward. That’s another reason why economic missions like this are so important. Take horticulture. The world’s population is growing and with it the importance of sustainable horticulture. The Netherlands is a pioneer in developing crops that are less dependent on the weather and require less pesticide. We’re keen to share our expertise with Indonesia. And we want to learn about Indonesia’s own experiences. A good example is the partnership between research institutes in Bandung and Wageningen, which is aimed at enhancing horticultural production. </p><p>We’re also supporting each other in the agri-food sector. A training programme has been set up to help Indonesian fish producers understand EU safety standards and regulations. That will help them enter the European market. So the Netherlands can be an important bridge to the European market in the same way that Indonesia can be a bridge to the ASEAN market.</p><p>Our collaboration in the area of water is particularly important, and has been for years. The benefits cut both ways. The Netherlands is closely involved in helping to protect Jakarta against flooding. And in the process, we’re learning a lot about how to deal with flood risks we may face in the future. This kind of cooperation can produce fantastic innovations. Only last week, the Dutch-Indonesian water filter company Nazava received a prestigious Tech Award in Silicon Valley. By producing user-friendly household water filters that don’t require gas, wood or electricity, this technology has given 75,000 people access to healthy drinking water. But Nazava’s ambitions don’t stop there. By 2016, the company wants to reach one million users.</p><p>Tomorrow I will be visiting Jakarta’s coastal region together with the Minister of Public Works and the Deputy Governor. Engineering firm Royal HaskoningDHV is involved in expanding Jakarta’s port area. And late last year, dredging firm Van Oord won a contract to deepen the port and reclaim land for a new port terminal. CEO Pieter van Oord described the project as pooling Indonesia’s economic power and Van Oord’s marine engineering expertise.</p><p>Pooling resources. That’s what it’s all about. We should follow this example. Not only when it comes to port development, but in all kinds of sectors. That should be our focus in the coming days.</p><p>What are the Netherlands’ and Indonesia’s strong points? And how can we best support each other? Let’s talk about our expectations, about taking down barriers and about seizing opportunities. Above all, let’s establish new contacts and pay attention to our existing relationships.</p><p>That is something we’re doing today, of course – in our sessions on five key sectors: agri-food, horticulture, water, life sciences and health, and logistics.</p><p>Let’s think big. Let’s think out of the box. To version 2.0 of our relationship! To Dutch cheese and croquettes, and hopefully some modern Indonesian delicacies, too! But with a Dutch twist, like Spekkoek Kentang and Pisang Goreng Keju.</p><p>Terima kasih!</p>",4
77,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, </p><p> I would also like to welcome you and thank you for coming this evening. It is good to have this chance to meet. </p><p> I have just come from a dinner with President Xi Jinping. </p><p> We had a long talk about the good working partnership between our countries. </p><p> And about all the opportunities for making that partnership even stronger. Not least in the economic arena. </p><p> So what could be better than to talk straight away to the very companies and research institutions that can capitalise on these opportunities? </p><p> Very shortly, no less than five cooperation agreements will be signed here. </p><p> Together they are a fine example of what our countries have to offer each other. </p><p> They cover a range of sectors and themes: aviation, chemicals, flowers, LED lighting and the financial sector. </p><p> I think this wide range of subjects highlights the success of economic cooperation between China and the Netherlands. </p><p> And let us not underestimate the importance of that cooperation. </p><p> The Netherlands is China's second-biggest trading partner in the European Union. </p><p> The volume of trade between our countries was almost 40 billion euros in 2012. </p><p> Between 2004 and 2012, Dutch investments in China increased almost tenfold, to 12 billion euros. </p><p> Around one thousand Dutch companies now operate in China. </p><p> While over 350 Chinese companies have set up shop in the Netherlands. And on both sides the numbers are rising. </p><p> The differences between our two countries - even if only in terms of size - are bridged by what unites us: an enterprising spirit, a business mindset, and a pragmatic, result-focused approach. </p><p> This underpins our countries' joint success. </p><p> The Netherlands is a small country doing big business. </p><p> We are the 17th-biggest economy and the world's second- biggest agricultural exporter. </p><p> A quick look at the map shows that this is no mean achievement. </p><p> In fields like agri-food, life sciences and water technology, Dutch firms are among the global leaders. </p><p> And as the gateway to Europe, the Netherlands plays an important role in the world economy. </p><p> Almost half of China's exports to Europe enter via the port of Rotterdam or Amsterdam Airport. </p><p> Looking in the opposite direction, the Netherlands has great respect for the lightning pace of China's development. </p><p> Everything here is expressed in big numbers: 1.3 billion inhabitants, over 120 cities with over one million people, and growth figures that have been about 10 per cent for decades. </p><p> In four decades your country has become the world's second-largest economy. </p><p> And with your consistently high growth figures it seems only a matter of time before you are number one. </p><p> This massive achievement has lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty. </p><p> On the global stage too, China is assuming a role that befits its status of economic and political superpower. </p><p> The Netherlands has a high regard for China's contribution. </p><p> Soon our countries will stand shoulder-to-shoulder in the UN mission in Mali. </p><p> And in the fight against international piracy we are also working towards a common goal. </p><p> We greatly value this cooperation. </p><p> At the same time, China's rapid economic rise also poses new challenges. </p><p> The same challenges we often face in Europe, but sometimes in a different form. </p><p> For instance, how can we use state-of-the-art infrastructure to keep our cities and industrial centres accessible? </p><p> How can we make sure that the air we breathe, the food we eat and the water we drink are clean and safe? </p><p> And what effect will our rapidly aging population have on health care? </p><p> In tackling these challenges, it is good to hear about each other's experiences and solutions. </p><p> We are keen to learn from you. </p><p> And the Netherlands has very specific knowledge in some of these fields that we would be pleased to share. </p><p> Ladies and gentlemen, the exciting story of China's rise as a global economic power is captivating the world. </p><p> And the Netherlands is very able and more than willing to join China on this historic journey. </p><p> Good and frequent contacts at the highest political level are very important in this regard. </p><p> But it's businesses like yours - big and small - that make a difference in today's economies. </p><p> It's business people like you that take risks and make things happen. Your partnerships and your success will not only shape the future of your own company but the development of both our countries. </p><p> I am very keen to hear what you have to say. </p><p> What opportunities exist? </p><p> What barriers do we still need to take away? </p><p> What is your view on building an even closer working relationship between our two countries? </p><p> Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is yours. </p><p> Thank you.</p>",8
78,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Welcome to the Netherlands, and welcome especially to The Hague.</p><p>As the legal capital of the world, this city is also a symbol for children’s rights. So there is no better place to award the International Children’s Peace Prize each year. Norway is the home of the Nobel Peace Prize,and the Netherlands is the home of the Children’s Peace Prize. And that’s something we are very proud of.</p><p>In the Dutch newspapers, I recently read about a new cartoon superhero, or rather superheroine: Pakistan’s Burka Avenger. Dressed in a shiny black veil, she fights for the right of girls to go to school. In everyday life, the Burka Avenger is actually a primary school teacher. But if she sees one of her girls under attack, she turns into a superhero who silences her opponents. Not with violence, but with books and pens as weapons. Children in Pakistan can now enjoy her adventures on TV.</p><p>Pakistan’s real superhero, of course, is not a cartoon character. In fact, she is here with us today. Malala, before the eyes of the international media, you dared to speak up for the right to education. And you didn’t let a cowardly and appalling attack stop you. That requires the courage of a superhero. There are very few people like you in the world. I am delighted and honoured that you and your family could join us in the Netherlands today.</p><p>All around the world, people are talking about the Malala effect. Take six-year-old Fatima from the village of Kot Lakhpat near the Pakistani city of Lahore. She is now able to go to school for the first time. Because her mother was inspired by your story, Malala. By what happened to you.</p><p>So you see, something positive has come out of that terrible attack. Thanks to you, many girls in Pakistan and other countries are now going to school. Ladies and gentlemen, Malala is fighting for something very important. Education is not only vital for individual children, but also for society as whole. It is an essential weapon in the battle against poverty, disease and conflict. And it is the key to democracy and economic development. That’s why the international community needs to have sky-high ambitions in this field.</p><p>Mr Brown, as the UN’s Special Envoy for Global Education, described that ambition as follows: 'We want to be the first generation in history where every child is able to go to school and to learn.' And that’s an ambition I share. Because worldwide, 57 million children still do not go to school. And 300 million children are taught so badly that they don’t learn to read and write. And most of them are girls. They are not allowed to go to school, or are forced to marry very young and are taken out of school. Yet giving girls an education can at least double a country’s potential.</p><p>I was in Afghanistan earlier this year. Despite the real progress that has been made there over the past ten years, there are still far too few girls going to school. Since 2002, the Netherlands has been trying to help. By building new schools in Uruzgan, for example.</p><p>Simple things make all the difference. Training women teachers encourages more families to let their daughters go to school. So does building separate toilets for girls and offering community-based education.</p><p>Fortunately, we are seeing positive results. The number of primary school-age children not going to school halved between 2000 and 2011. That is a fundamental change.</p><p>And now for the other half. Because every child deserves the chance to unlock their full potential. And that is the reason behind this gathering. The International Children’s Peace Prize offers a platform for children who are fighting injustice in the world. Children who help the world progress and make it a better place.</p><p>This prize gives them the recognition, the publicity and the resources they need to fight for what they believe in. These children are already making a difference. Showing that you don’t have to be an adult to make your mark on the world. Malala, you gave an impressive speech to the UN in July. You said that ‘one child, one teacher, one book, and one pen can change the world’. And you are living proof of that.</p><p>It is an honour for this city to be able to present this prize for the ninth time to a young citizen of the world. A young citizen who has the courage to speak out and call the world to action.</p><p>Let me close by saying this to all the nominees and winners of the Children’s Peace Prize: you are all superheroes.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",1
79,"<p>Ambassador Marsudi, ladies and gentlemen, ibu-ibu dan bapak-bapak,</p><p>Selamat sore, hello, and terima kasih: thank you for inviting me to be here for the 68th anniversary of the Proklamasi of 17 August 1945. The day the Republic of Indonesia declared its independence.</p><p>The Netherlands and Indonesia are closely related. Our histories are interwoven. You can see it in the signs for kantor pos you find in Jakarta. In the 400,000 Dutch nationals with Indonesian roots. In the Villa Isola in Bandung, designed by Dutch architect Wolff Schoemaker. And in the many Indonesian tokos in the Netherlands.</p><p>Our shared past has been turbulent. We can't ignore that reality on a day like this. But we have been through this experience together, and together we have come out on the other side. Today we can again show that Indonesia and the Netherlands have not only a shared past but also a shared future. Two sovereign nations, each with its own territorial integrity. We can show that we stand side-by-side, looking ahead. I consider it a special honour that I – as prime minister of the Netherlands – have been invited to join the Independence Day celebrations here at the embassy. Thank you again.</p><p>My own personal history is also tied up with your country. My father moved to Jakarta in the early 1930s. He, his first wife and their three children spent the war there, in Japanese camps. After the war, he and his second wife – my mother – returned to Indonesia and remained there until the 1950s.</p><p>Although I have never been to Indonesia myself, I feel a connection. Almost as if I’d lived there. It’s partly because of my childhood and my life in The Hague – the most Indonesian city in the Netherlands. It's no secret that the restaurant Soeboer is one of my all-time favourites. But mainly it’s down to my father, who never got tired of telling me stories of his life in Indonesia, and to the nasi goreng my mother made every Saturday for dinner. I remember she always used to buy her spices from Bali, a restaurant in Scheveningen.</p><p>I admit I’m a bit nostalgic, but I’m not the only one. Ten per cent of Dutch people have some kind of link with Indonesia. Every year, tens of thousands of Dutch tourists travel to your beautiful country. Our shared history, community and culture are great assets. And starting from that shared past, our countries have a lot to offer each other in the future, too.</p><p>Because alongside our historical and emotional bond, we also have firm economic ties. Thanks to Schiphol airport and the port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands is Indonesia's gateway to Europe. In 2012 we were the sixth-biggest investor in Indonesia – to the tune of one billion dollars. Within the EU, the Netherlands is Indonesia's top export destination and second-biggest trade partner. Many Dutch companies are based in Indonesia. In fact, Indonesia is a key market for companies like Unilever and FrieslandCampina.</p><p>The give-and-take between our countries is also reflected in our cultural relations. Dutch and Indonesian culture come together at the Erasmus Huis in Jakarta. And since the 1950s, more than 20,000 Indonesians have studied in the Netherlands. Many Dutch students have found their way to Indonesia too.</p><p>For years now, water management has been a vital area of cooperation between us. The benefits are mutual: by working closely with Indonesia to help protect Jakarta from flooding, the Netherlands is also learning a lot about the kinds of flood risks we could face in the future. So it’s good news for both countries that our cooperation agreements in this area were recently renewed and reinforced.</p><p>Despite these difficult economic times, Indonesia is doing well. And I admire your success. Your economy is growing and poverty is declining, creating a growing middle class. Since the Reformasi you have also made substantial progress in enhancing the legal order. In doing so, Indonesia has shown that a robust economy and a robust society feed into one another. This is all reflected in the increasingly prominent role Indonesia is playing on the world stage. It is an active and important member of the G20, the UN and, above all, ASEAN.</p><p>Minister Timmermans visited your country in February this year. And I’m delighted that I will be visiting Indonesia myself in November, along with a large Dutch business delegation. There we will reaffirm our comprehensive partnership agreement, with an eye to the future and our economic relations. It will be the first visit by a Dutch prime minister since 2006. So it’s about time! After all, face to face contacts are vital for the long-term success of our relationship.</p><p>I’m looking forward to my visit, for personal as well as professional reasons. But I realise, of course, that the Indonesia of my father’s fond tales has now evolved into a global economic and political powerhouse.</p><p>Let us raise a glass to the ties that bind us, and to the future success of our countries’ partnership.</p><p>Terima kasih.</p>",6
80,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p>At first glance, Texas and the Netherlands don’t seem to have a lot in common. For us, faraway Texas evokes images of cowboys, saloons and vast plains. And to you, perhaps, the Netherlands is a land of wooden shoes, tulips and windmills. While Texans jump in their cars, the Dutch hop on their bikes. While the Netherlands is small, everything in Texas is big, bigger, biggest. </p><p>Yet two Dutch families by the name of Rienstra and Doornbos, who settled in Texas in 1897, saw something of their country here. In fact, they felt so at home that they founded a town called Nederland, an hour-and-a-half away from here. The town still exists today, complete with a tulip festival, windmill and dyke, or so I’ve heard.</p><p>Perhaps the town’s founders sensed that one day the Netherlands and Texas would establish close ties. Because our differences aren’t as big as they may seem. In fact, we have a lot in common. Texas is world famous for its oil and gas, and the Dutch-Flemish delta region has an unrivalled position in the petrochemical industry. The Dutch chemical industry, for example, has a positive trade balance of 24 billion euros. One reason for this success is our long tradition in this field, which has helped us build up an excellent knowledge base. Together, the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam form the gateway to Europe. Excellent connections to the rest of Europe make the delta region a major hub for imports and exports. And many companies, including businesses from Texas, make use of it for their raw materials and for logistics. Just as the Port of Houston is the gateway to America. </p><p>The success of our petrochemical cluster is partly due to our close relations with companies from Texas. We are proud of this success and we want to build on it. That’s why we’re investing more in innovation and expanding our port facilities and logistics services. To achieve this we are stepping up partnership between government, businesses and universities. In the Netherlands and Flanders, and here in Texas. </p><p>Some 110 Dutch companies are already active in your state, including big names like Shell, AkzoNobel and Heineken. And Flemish people can be found in senior positions at ExxonMobil. The Belgian-Dutch region is the second-biggest investor in the United States, investing 17 times more in your country than China, Brazil, India and Russia put together. Incredible, really, when you look at a map of the world. We may be small in size, but when it comes to trade and investment we can match almost any country. </p><p>At the same time, the United States is the biggest direct investor in the Netherlands, with Texas as the number-one state.</p><p>Let me give you a few more figures. Dutch investment and trade has created 680,000 jobs in the US, with no fewer than 100,000 in Texas. The total trade volume between Texas and our delta region is 15 billion dollars. So the Lone Star State is vital to trade relations between our countries. </p><p>Of course, there’s always room for improvement. And that’s why we’re here. Kris Peeters and I have brought along some of our colleagues and a large business delegation from Flanders and the Netherlands. Our aim? To make this relationship even better and more profitable for everyone involved.</p><p>With this in mind, I am very pleased that the United States and the EU have decided to start negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. We want to achieve even lower tariffs for importers and exporters. We want to create more uniform standards and procedures to make things less complicated for American and European entrepreneurs. And we want to provide better access to each other’s markets. The result will be more growth, more jobs and more prosperity for Texas, Flanders and the Netherlands. </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I understand that the name Texas comes from the Caddo tribe word ‘tejas’, meaning friends or allies. We’ve been friends, or tejas, for a long time now. It’s no coincidence that we were among the first countries to establish diplomatic ties with your state when it gained its independence. The Dutch flag flying at the Institute of Texan Cultures in San Antonio is evidence of this. Cooperation between Flanders, the Netherlands and Texas and between our companies has solid foundations. I have no doubt that this joint mission and this gathering here today will make our friendship and our partnership even stronger. </p><p>Thank you.</p><p>I shall now give the floor to my Flemish colleague Kris Peeters. </p>",0
81,"<p>Mayor Parker, Secretary of State Steen, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>As a teenager, I had a clear picture of Texas: men in cowboy hats rounding up cattle, endless plains where oil pumps went up and down all day, vast ranches with sheep and horses…and JR and Sue Ellen locking horns with each other.</p><p>That’s because my image of Texas was largely shaped by all the drama at Southfork Ranch, home of the Ewings in the television series Dallas. And I wasn’t the only one. Every week, seven million Dutch viewers were glued to their screens. And when Dutch TV stopped broadcasting the series, we all tuned to the Flemish channels, anxious not to miss an episode.    </p><p>But our ties go beyond television. Flemish and Dutch people speak the same language, share a common history and culture and are on good terms as friends and neighbours. But two regions and two prime ministers joining forces on a trade mission is unique for us. And that’s surprising, really. Take a map of Europe and you’ll see Flanders and the Netherlands united as one big coastal delta, a region that forms the gateway to Europe. So teaming up makes sense. </p><p>That’s why we’re here with a delegation of over 90 Flemish and Dutch companies and more than 120 businessmen and women. From a variety of sectors: oil and gas, chemicals, ports and smart grids. All ready to do business right here in Texas. </p><p>The Netherlands and Flanders share a solid economic infrastructure, centring on the oil, gas and petrochemical industries. We specialise in transport, logistics, oil, gas and chemicals, as well as in high-tech manufacturing, research and innovation. Our highly developed transport and logistics infrastructure boasts major ports, like Antwerp and Rotterdam, combined with the highest density of freeways and railroads in Europe. A vast network of inland waterways and leading passenger and cargo airports connects our delta to the rest of Europe and the rest of the world. We host nearly all of the world’s major chemical companies and a great many world-class R&D institutes for fundamental and applied research. </p><p>The Dutch-Flemish delta region has an unrivalled position in the petrochemical industry. The Dutch chemical industry, for example, has a positive trade balance of 24 billion euros. One reason for this success is our long tradition in this field, which has helped us build up an excellent knowledge base. Many companies, including businesses from Texas, benefit from the delta region as the main European hub for their raw materials and for logistics. </p><p>We may be small in size, but when it comes to trade and investment we can match almost any country. We rank near the top of the list of the world’s largest exporting nations. And the United States has for many generations been one of our major trading partners. </p><p>As a region we invest more in the United States than 17 times the investments of China, Brazil, India and Russia put together. On a similar note, our delta region is the number-one destination in the world for US foreign direct investment. In that sense, Texas hasn’t got a monopoly on ‘big’. </p><p>I am very pleased that the United States and the EU have decided to start negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. I am convinced that a partnership of this kind will give a tremendous boost to economic growth and job creation on both sides of the Atlantic. In Texas, in Flanders and in the Netherlands. We want to achieve even lower tariffs for importers and exporters. We want to create more uniform standards and procedures to make things less complicated for American and European entrepreneurs. And we want to provide better access to each other’s markets. </p><p>Ladies and gentleman, your state shows impressive economic figures. The Texan ‘can do’ attitude combined with the fighting spirit that harks back to the days of the Alamo creates a perfect climate in which our businesses can flourish.  </p><p>In fact, Texas is already the state with the most Dutch foreign direct investment and the state that exports the most goods and services to the Netherlands. If we add Flanders to the mix, we reach an impressive total trade volume of over 15 billion dollars between Texas and our delta. To put this into perspective, it’s estimated that our trade and investment relations have created over 100,000 jobs in Texas. There’s no doubt about it − the Lone Star State is vital to the economic ties between our countries.</p><p>And that’s exactly why Minister-President Peeters and I are leading this trade mission personally. We want to act as enablers − opening doors and fostering economic cooperation between our regions. So it’s a great privilege to be here tonight in Houston.</p><p>Before giving the floor to you, Mr Secretary, I would like to give Minister-President Peeters the opportunity to share his thoughts on our mission as well.</p><p>Mayor Parker, Mr Secretary, ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for being here with us this evening.</p>",5
82,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Recently, the Hürriyet Daily News published an interesting article that could almost have been written for this seminar. It was about the sustainable business strategy and Turkish operations of Unilever, the well-known multinational with Dutch roots. Without batting an eyelid, the top Turkish executive quoted in the article said that by 2015 all the vegetables and tea that Unilever buys in Turkey would come from sustainable sources. That’s only two years from now. This local goal is even more ambitious than the one hundred per cent that Unilever is aiming for worldwide by 2020.</p><p>I myself worked at Unilever from 1992 to 2002. So I was right there when the company started its drive for sustainable growth. Today, Unilever is a global leader in the field.</p><p>Of course, I am not here to represent Unilever. Sustainability is firmly rooted in the business operations of so many Dutch companies. In fact, a few months ago, several major multinationals in the Netherlands joined forces to set up the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition. Alongside Unilever these are Heineken, FrieslandCampina, Shell, Philips, AkzoNobel, KLM and DSM, all global players and market leaders in their own, very different sectors. This underscores the support there now is for sustainable business models − and shows that business is leading the way. More and more companies are opting for sustainable and socially responsible business practices, and nine times out of ten they beat the government to it. I don’t think that the pioneers of this approach in the 1990s could have imagined just how quickly things would move forward.</p><p>There can be no doubt at all about the reasons for this choice. Business is business. These companies realise that sustainability is the future and that there is much to be gained from leading the way. Or, as the title of this seminar rightly points out, sustainability offers competitive advantages. Raw materials like oil are becoming scarcer and more expensive. The world’s population will have grown to 9 billion by 2050. More and more consumers are switching to sustainable products, because they’re aware of the impact of today’s choices on tomorrow’s problems. So sustainability is a clear business case. It promotes growth and is essential to long-term business success. Because it saves costs and fosters customer loyalty. And in essence, business continuity is also a form of sustainability.</p><p>I should emphasise that sustainability and corporate social responsibility are not a gimmick. Companies cannot use them to boost their sales and profits overnight. A thin layer of corporate social responsibility simply doesn’t work. If anything, the reverse is true. If it is not genuine, people will easily see through it.</p><p>So companies that successfully follow a sustainable business model have made the concept part of their corporate DNA. From the boardroom to the shop floor, and from headquarters to the smallest branch. And their approach has substance. Companies like these are setting themselves major, measurable goals and they make those goals visible to the outside world. Because they want to be accountable. Like Unilever with its tea production in Turkey. Like FrieslandCampina, which wants to be fully sustainable by 2020, while helping 40,000 small farmers in Africa and Asia boost their earnings. Or like the Turkish company Arçelik, which has developed the world’s most water- and energy-efficient dishwasher. In Turkey alone, this will help secure the water needs of 500,000 more people.</p><p>And there are so many more examples like these. Examples that increasingly extend beyond borders, in line with our globalising economy. And that is exactly where this seminar comes in. The Dutch and Turkish economies are becoming more and more closely intertwined. Over the past decade, trade between our countries has tripled and continues to grow rapidly. So it makes sense to work together on sustainable innovation. By sharing knowledge and experience we can unlock bigger markets and create new opportunities.</p><p>The Dutch concerns I have mentioned are trendsetters in this field. But following on behind them is a broad and growing layer of small and medium-sized businesses that are also pursuing a sustainable growth strategy. Holland has become a sustainable brand. But things are moving fast here in Turkey too. This seminar is all about helping each other to develop new products and organisational models. And above all, to get to know each other’s markets. What works and what doesn’t? That’s a key question when doing business abroad.</p><p>In anticipation of our panel discussion, I should say that governments also have a role to play on this stage, but certainly not the leading part. Governments can stimulate sustainability, through tax measures or subsidies, for example. Through a targeted innovation policy that forges links between knowledge centres and businesses. And through economic diplomacy that provides opportunities for seminars like this. But what governments cannot do – and should not seek to do – is take over the role that businesses play.</p><p>Kees van der Waaij, one of my mentors at Unilever and a pioneer of sustainable business, once said, ‘When trying to make the world a better place people overestimate the role of government and underestimate the role of businesses’. I couldn’t agree more. After all, we talk about corporate social responsibility, not government responsibility.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, on that note I would like to wish you a rewarding seminar and, of course, plenty of sustainable business success in the future. </p><p>Thank you.</p>",2
83,"<p>Ambassador Levin, Ms King, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>First of all: it’s good to be back in Chicago. I’ve been here once before, for an ice cream conference held in 2002 by Unilever, my employer at the time. Since then a lot has changed in Chicago and in my career. But two things have remained the same: the curse of the Billy Goat and my love of ice cream. When I first came here I could never have imagined that, one day, I would have the honour of addressing the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. So thank you for inviting me. I’m looking forward to the discussion we’ll have shortly. But first a few words of introduction.</p><p>When I was preparing for today, I recalled something Margaret Thatcher, one of my all-time favourite politicians, once said. ‘Europe will never be like America’, she said. ‘Europe is a product of history. America is a product of philosophy.’ It’s a great quote, one of many that the Iron Lady has to her name. But speaking as a former student of history, I’ve never entirely agreed with her on this point. Of course there are real contrasts between Europe and the United States: economic, political, social and cultural. But it is history, our historical ties, that make our differences minor compared with what we have in common.</p><p>Take, for instance, your historical ties with my country, the Netherlands. Here are a few facts. The Pilgrim Fathers found refuge in the Dutch town of Leiden before setting sail for the New World in 1620. New York was originally founded as New Amsterdam, a Dutch trading post. The Netherlands was the first country, 230 years ago, to establish diplomatic relations with the United States. And you can even trace a direct line between the American Declaration of Independence and our own Act of Abjuration. That’s the document that marked the birth of the Dutch Republic, in which the Dutch provinces rejected their Spanish overlord, King Philip II, in 1581. It was the first time a people had ‘deposed’ a monarch in such a way. In that sense ‘our’ King Philip was ‘your’ King George. Of course, there are many more historical connections like this and they also involve other European countries.</p><p>But it was only in the twentieth century that those historical ties grew into a unique form of transatlantic solidarity. The First and Second World Wars, and the Cold War that followed, brought America and Europe ever closer together: from a political, military and economic point of view. Right up to the present day. It was and remains an alliance based on a number of fundamental shared values: democracy, freedom, the rule of law and a belief in free market principles. No wonder President Obama speaks of Europe as ‘the cornerstone of our engagement with the world’. I can assure you that for Europe, and certainly for the Dutch government, the reverse is equally true.</p><p>But even an alliance built on such strong foundations has to be maintained. We must never take the transatlantic relationship for granted. And that’s the key message I bring with me to Chicago. That it’s vital that the US and Europe continue working on their relationship, to keep it up to date. Because we need you, and you need us. Because in our dealings with other countries we are better off working together than by ourselves. But also because the world around us is changing continuously and changing circumstances demand action. The debt crisis in Europe, America’s economic prospects, the rise of the BRICs, the Arab Spring, the alarming situations in countries like Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan and, of course, Syria: these developments all impact on each other and on the transatlantic relationship.</p><p>This week’s NATO summit in this beautiful city will explore some of these topics. But the transatlantic relationship goes beyond safety and security. There is at least one other dimension that deserves our constant attention. I’m talking, of course, about the economy. These two dimensions reinforce each other. It’s a two-way street. The more we can increase safety and security in the world, the better America and Europe can promote their shared international economic interests – and the more people in other countries will gain access to global markets. So NATO’s strategic military alliance and our transatlantic economic cooperation are directly connected. I’d like to say a few words about each dimension.</p><p>First, the economy. Because in spite of all the economic problems we need to solve in our own countries and our own region, we should never forget the importance of the economic relations that exist between America and Europe. Or how dynamic those relations are. Let’s look at the facts: the US and Europe jointly account for about half of global GDP. That’s enormous. The mutual flow of goods and services is worth 2.7 billion dollars every day. This equals 15 million jobs on both sides of the ocean. What’s more, direct investment by America in Europe, and direct investment by Europe in America, greatly outweigh their investment in any other region in the world.</p><p>The figures for my own country are no less impressive. The US is the biggest foreign investor in the Netherlands. But, more surprising perhaps, the Netherlands – a country whose economy ranks number 16 in the world, which covers an area only a tenth of California, and which has fewer inhabitants than Florida ¬– is the third biggest investor in the US. Or to put it differently, about 625,000 American jobs are created by Dutch investment in the US and US exports to the Netherlands. That’s more or less the population of Washington, DC.</p><p>I could go on. There are many more figures which tell the same story. But I think the point is clear. The question now is: how can we expand our relationship? How can we – by working even closer together – create more high-value jobs and make ourselves more competitive in international markets? These are the questions we should keep in mind as we make our way through the current crisis and beyond. And I’m pleased to say that the American government thinks the same way. When I visited President Obama last November, we quickly agreed that only three topics really mattered: jobs, jobs and more jobs.</p><p>That’s why the Netherlands attaches such importance to the joint High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth. The figures I just mentioned make it clear that even a small improvement in transatlantic economic cooperation can have a big positive impact. Greater economic integration, more free trade and the removal of trade barriers can provide an enormous stimulus to our economies. A deep and comprehensive free trade agreement would boost the national incomes of the United States and Europe by many billions of dollars and euros per year. Of course you can’t set up a free trade zone overnight. But there are strong arguments for working step by step towards that goal. And the Netherlands is keen to take those steps.</p><p>Improving economic cooperation is also important from another perspective. Both the US and Europe stand to gain by promoting the strong and stable development of the emerging economies in Asia and South America. And we know from experience that  you need more than just good growth figures. A strong economy is built on a strong society. A society in which people have sufficient confidence in the future to invest in themselves by means of education. To buy houses and consumer goods. To save, to start a business, to take part in society. In that sense democratic principles, the free market, human rights and the rule of law have a direct bearing on a country’s prosperity and the welfare of its people.</p><p>America and Europe can play a more effective role here by acting together, from a position of strength. Together we are better placed to guide other countries towards stable socioeconomic development. Together we can also do more to shape the development and growth of global trade along free market lines. That sounds idealistic, but we can do it by staying realistic and taking one step at a time. So I’m not calling for the overzealous promotion of democracy and high moral standards. What I am saying is that we should encourage, recognise and also reward steps in the right direction. Like the current US government and the European Union are doing in Myanmar, to give you just one example.</p><p>So we need to step up our economic cooperation and we need to join forces in our dealings with third countries. That, in a nutshell, is how I think we should move forward, now that Europe is no longer America’s geopolitical focus of attention. To be fair, our new position does take a bit of getting used to. But I also see it as proof that, in American eyes, the European Union has attained a certain maturity, despite our problems with the euro. And with maturity comes responsibility. There is no reason why Europe should shy away from that. Now Europe is fixing what needs to be fixed in its monetary system and also looks beyond this crisis for new opportunities for growth and jobs. As you may have noticed: that is a work in progress.</p><p>Of course, the shift in emphasis in US foreign policy also has a direct influence on developments within NATO, which we’ll be talking about this week. And let me be frank: it’s understandable that the division of costs is being called into question. The outspoken farewell speech delivered by former Defence Secretary Gates in Brussels did not pass unnoticed in Europe. As you know, three quarters of the NATO bill is paid by the United States and a quarter by Europe. At the same time, because of the crisis, defence budgets everywhere are being tightened – also in the US. And we’re facing new kinds of threats, like cyberterrorism, which conventional military means aren’t equipped to deal with. So we’re being squeezed on two fronts: financial and strategic.</p><p>Against this backdrop, I’m pleased that NATO and this NATO summit are aiming towards innovation and smart solutions on both fronts. The Netherlands, for example, is a strong advocate of ‘smart defence’. And we aim to be one of the lead nations in this field. By working together even closer, by sharing information better and sooner, we can increase the return on our NATO investment in terms of people and resources. In short, we can get greater value for the same money. The Netherlands has positive experiences  with smart defence that perhaps can be put to use in developing the concept. For instance, since the mid-nineties there has been a Dutch-German army corps and for some time now the Dutch navy has been working closely together with its Belgian counterpart.</p><p>As regards the specific role we play in NATO, the Netherlands has a reputation for being a reliable and active partner. And we intend to keep it that way. Within NATO, but also elsewhere. For instance, we were recently delighted to say ‘yes’ when asked to host the next Nuclear Security Summit – an initiative of President Obama which has our firm backing.</p><p>At the same time, it’s true that the defence budget has been cut back in my country too for a number of years now. But that has not stopped us, for instance, playing an important role in Afghanistan. Up to the end of 2010 we had a strong military presence of 2,000 personnel in Uruzgan. Now we are helping the Afghans by conducting a police training mission in Kunduz. And looking beyond 2014, it is clear that the need for international involvement will remain. As before, the Netherlands stands ready to make a contribution. A contribution that takes full account of the responsibility and independence of the Afghans themselves. And one in which the ‘Dutch trademark’ will again be recognisable. Because the Netherlands always opts for an integrated approach, in which all elements interconnect. Security and justice, development and enterprise, freedom and responsibility.</p><p>And so, ladies and gentlemen, in about 20 minutes we’ve gone from the ice cream business, via history and the economy, to international peace and security. That sounds like a complicated journey, but in the end my message centres on two ideas: dialogue and cooperation. That is what made the transatlantic relationship strong in the past, and that is what can help us move forward in the future. We do have similar interests and a similar cultural background, but I’m not saying that Margaret Thatcher was talking nonsense. She was right that Europe and America will never be perfectly alike. But they are perfectly complementary. Which is even better.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",17
84,"<p>Freedom of Speech and Expression, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, Freedom from Fear: with these words, Franklin Roosevelt defined a world based on the fundamental concept that all people – everywhere in the world – have the right to live free from the scourge of poverty, at peace with themselves and with their neighbours; a world where everyone has the right to earn a living wage; a world where the voice of the poor stands on equal footing with that of the rich and powerful.</p><p>On this, the twelfth day of May 2012, we honour a man who has dedicated his life to this vision, by presenting the International Franklin Delano Roosevelt Four Freedoms Award to Mr Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, or, as everyone knows him, ‘Lula’.</p><p>The son of peasants born in the dust bowl of north-eastern Brazil, Lula has known one constant in his life: the need to work. It was this reality that led his mother to travel 1,900 miles on the back of a flat-bed truck to the slums of São Paulo when he was only seven years old. And this reality that led him to shine shoes and sell candy on the street to help his single mother support him and his seven siblings. At the age of 14, with only a fifth-grade education, he left school to work at a screw manufacturing plant that enrolled him in a technical school where he became certified as a lathe operator.</p><p>Lula would spend the rest of his adolescence working in a sheet metal plant, where at 19 he lost his little finger on the graveyard shift. These struggles, and the encouragement of his older brother ‘Frei Chico’, led him to make one of the most important decisions in his life: to join the labour movement. </p><p>In those days, when Brazil was ruled by a military junta, championing labour was a dangerous activity. Yet Lula persisted and became president of the metal workers union of São Bernardo do Campo, an industrial city in the São Paulo Metropolitan Area. By 1980 he had become a national figure, defying the generals and the bosses through a series of illegal strikes that practically shut down Brazil’s industrial sector. He was arrested as a threat to Brazil’s national security and spent 30 days in jail. Later, he would be tried and only after a few years would his conviction be overturned.</p><p>If anything, his arrest inspired Lula to work even harder for the rights of labour, and in 1980 he joined an effort to found the Partido dos Trabalhadores, or Workers Party. From 1982 on, the Workers Party fielded candidates in every election. In 1986 Lula achieved his first political victory by gaining a seat in the Brazilian Congress – with the best electoral result for a deputy in Brazilian history. In 1989 he decided to run for national office in the first democratic elections for president since 1960. He lost, but would run for president again and again. His critics dismissed him as unelectable. But Lula refused to give up, and in October 2002 he and the Brazilian people proved them wrong, securing the presidency with the biggest electoral landslide in Brazilian history.</p><p>Since that day Brazil, and indeed the rest of the world, has never been the same. As president, Lula’s pragmatic policies and steadfast determination to rid Brazil of extreme poverty and social injustice were an inspiration to people everywhere. Moreover, his lifelong commitment to social and economic justice, coupled with his resolve to help foster a climate of peace and reconciliation among all nations, led President Obama and others to call him ‘the most popular politician on earth’.</p><p>More than seven decades ago Franklin Roosevelt reminded us that for democracy to survive, we must insist that ‘the employer-employee relationship should be one between free men and equals’.  FDR insisted on this, because, like the man we celebrate today, he understood that without the dignity of work, and the right to enjoy the Four Freedoms, democracy cannot survive. It is in recognition of his tireless efforts to secure these essential human freedoms, not only for the people of his beloved country but for the less fortunate the world over, that we thank and honour Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.</p><p>I deeply regret that Lula cannot be here today to accept his Four Freedoms Award in person. But I am pleased and honoured that Mrs Clara Ant, who has known him so long and so well, is accepting the award on his behalf.</p>",1
85,"<p>Your Majesty, President and Mrs Gül, Your Royal Highness, Professor van Vollenhoven, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>At present there are 18,000 businesspeople of Turkish origin in the Netherlands. Many of them do business with Turkey. This confirms, 18,000 times over, the special economic ties between our two countries. Ties that are even older than the 400 years of diplomatic relations, which we are celebrating together this year.</p><p>Political and cultural exchanges also go back 400 years, making Turkish-Dutch relations even more remarkable. Turkey was one of the unexpected allies of the Republic of the United Provinces in our fight for independence from Spain. And as everyone knows, the tulip, our national symbol, was imported from Turkey. And the Netherlands and the tulip are still synonymous.</p><p>So this year we have a lot to remember and celebrate. And we are doing so in style. Commercial activities are planned, both in Turkey and here. Dutch masterpieces from the Rijksmuseum's collection are on exhibit in Istanbul. Turkish masterpieces have come to the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht. There are educational projects, special events for young people, and much more. So the conclusion is clear: after four centuries, Turkey and the Netherlands still have a lot to offer each other.</p><p>Mr President, for us, your visit to the Netherlands is a high point of this anniversary year. The Dutch government is delighted that you and Mrs Gül have come here with a big trade mission. This shows that the Turkish government and business community still take a great interest in our country, even after 400 years. I can assure you that our interest in Turkey is equally great. I'm looking forward to underscore this in person later this year, when I accompany Dutch business representatives on a visit to your country.</p><p>Here in the Netherlands we have followed the rapid economic progress that Turkey has made over the last decade with great interest and admiration. Today, your country is the 17th-largest economy in the world, and our country is the 16th-largest. But we will soon be trading places. I would like to congratulate you and the Turkish people in advance on your new ranking. Of course, economic expansion and prosperity are good for Turkey. But as your country is a major Dutch trading partner, this is also good for the Netherlands and good for Dutch business.</p><p>We in the Netherlands also have great respect for the international role that Turkey plays in promoting peace and security. I am pleased to note that this year, our two countries have been NATO allies for exactly 60 years, another anniversary worth commemorating. For 60 years the Dutch and Turkish armed forces have worked together for peace and security. And now that there are so many changes taking place in the Arab world, Turkey continues to shoulder responsibility outside the NATO framework too. The Netherlands values highly the very active role that Turkey is now playing in the Arab region. Especially your efforts to put an end to the terrible violence used by the Syrian regime against innocent civilians.</p><p>In this way Turkey is proving once more that it plays - and chooses to play - the key role of bridge in the dialogue between the West and the Islamic world. I hope we can seize the opportunity of this anniversary to bolster this dialogue so that we can look to the future together. Let us take steps forward wherever we can. Including the talks between Turkey and the European Union about your country's accession.</p><p>In closing, Mr President, it gives me pleasure to present you with a special gift. In honour of 400 years of diplomatic relations between Turkey and the Netherlands, our Ministry of Finance commissioned the artist Deniz Seyda Tunca to design a special five-euro coin. One side of the coin bears the Turkish flag and a tulip with closed petals, to show that your country is the homeland of this beautiful flower. The other side bears a portrait of our Queen and a tulip with open petals. So you see, this special coin symbolises a relationship that has flourished for four centuries.</p><p>As I present you with this special coin, I would like to propose a toast. To your health, Mr President, and that of Mrs Gül. To the friendship between our two countries. And to our common future.</p>",4
86,"<p>Your Royal Highness, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Last November I crossed the Atlantic to visit President Obama. It was my first visit to the White House, but by no means my first visit to the US. It’s always been a favourite destination of mine, because the US, New York especially, fascinates me. I love the culture of optimism and the faith in progress. The constant drive to do business and succeed. And of course the Americans themselves, who radiate this spirit all day, every day. It fills you with energy. And I’m a fan of American politics, too. I’m looking forward to the presidential election campaign, which we can follow day by day in the Netherlands.</p><p>In the White House President Obama and I of course discussed the global economic crisis, the subject at the top of everyone’s agenda these days. The key word was ‘jobs’. But we also had time to reflect on over 400 years of good relations between our countries. And on our outstanding trading ties, given an extra boost for the past 50 years by the American Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>The American Chamber of Commerce opened for business in the Netherlands in 1961. The Dutch economy had fully recovered. Thanks in part to the Marshall Plan. In the 1950s and ’60s our economy grew almost non-stop, and unemployment fell to almost zero. And we began to look to America. Refrigerators, television sets and cars also began to find their way into Dutch homes. And as our prosperity increased, our self-confidence rose, almost to American levels. No wonder Americans thought there was money to be made in a country like ours. And they were right.</p><p>Even in today’s difficult economic climate, I’m glad to say, American interest in the Netherlands has not declined. Far from it. The US today invests more in the Netherlands than in Brazil, Russia, India and China combined. Around 1,800 American companies are currently active in this country. They are benefiting fully from our favourable business climate, our strategic position, our competitive tax regime and our innovative technology base. It helps that 85% of Dutch people can speak English, so you don’t have to strain your throats with our ‘g’s’. Unless of course you expats end up in Scheveningen; there I can’t help you.</p><p>And US interest in the Netherlands is matched by Dutch interest in the US. We are the third-largest investor in the US. Dutch investments are responsible for 625,000 American jobs. And in our country, US investment has created 225,000 jobs. President Obama and I are in full agreement: in times like these, preserving and creating jobs must be our absolute top priority.</p><p>So we have to keep working towards this. Fortunately, we have plenty of opportunities. The Netherlands’ great dream is a comprehensive free trade zone uniting the US and the European Union. That’s something we can’t achieve without the business community. So join with us in thinking about this, not only for us, but also in your own interest. This free trade zone would give a tremendous boost to innovation, growth and employment on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>Though I realise we can’t achieve this overnight, during my visit to Washington we did take another step forward towards closer cooperation. I mean of course the big CEO Roundtable that will be held later this year. So many US and Dutch business and government leaders together in one room will, I’m sure, generate new ideas, and above all new investments. So the American Chamber of Commerce has a busy period ahead!</p><p>Now before I round off, I must pay tribute to the work of the American Chamber of Commerce in another field. Because your involvement in our country does not stop at purely commercial activities. Through the programme ‘Champs on Stage’, you link up students in vocational education with American companies. In this way you make an important contribution to preventing school dropout in the Netherlands. Speaking as a former State Secretary for Education, I think that’s fantastic.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>After my visit to President Obama I left the US, as always, full of energy and new ideas. And President Obama made me a promise: to visit the Netherlands when he can. I look forward to welcoming him here. His exact words about the Netherlands were, and I quote: ‘All reports are that it is beautiful and the people are wonderful.’ It wouldn’t surprise me at all if those reports came from you. Because the American Chamber of Commerce has an unequalled ability to make people enthusiastic about coming to the Netherlands. Thanks to you, for 50 years Americans have been making their American dream come true here in this country. I would like to sincerely congratulate you on your achievement, and thank you for your outstanding work. During the last 50 years the Netherlands has been welcoming American businesspeople with open arms, and we will continue to do so for at least the next 50.</p><p>So spread the word and keep up the good work!</p><p>Thank you</p>",4
87,"<p>Ambassador Levin, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>On Tuesday 11 September 2001, at about five to nine in the morning, Ingeborg Lariby called her parents from her office on the 93rd floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center. She told them that a plane had crashed into the North Tower. But 'I'm OK,' she added. That phone call was the last time Ingeborg spoke to her parents. A few minutes later the second plane hit the South Tower.</p><p>We all still remember where we were when we saw those horrifying images. At first there was a feeling of irrational hope, as if we were watching something that wasn't really happening. But all too soon we faced the harsh reality, the plumes of smoke over Manhattan, the wailing of the sirens, the panic in the city streets, and finally the apocalyptic sight of the Twin Towers collapsing. The whole world was watching.</p><p>[…]</p><p>Ingeborg Lariby was only 42 when she died. Born in New York, of Dutch parents, she felt at home all over the world. 'Native of the Netherlands, citizen of everywhere' was how the New York Times described her. After years of travel, she had made Manhattan her home. That was where she achieved her professional ambitions. That was the base from which she stayed in touch with friends all over the world. That was where she enjoyed everything life and New York had to offer, which was a great deal.</p><p>Today, ten years later, we remember Ingeborg Lariby and all the other people who were taken from us that day.</p><p>Today we think back to that dark day when the unthinkable happened, when almost 3,000 people from more than 90 countries lost their lives in a series of cowardly terrorist attacks.</p><p>And today, with all our heart, we reach out again to the families and friends of the victims. As we did ten years ago, when we mourned with those who lost someone they loved at Ground Zero, in the Pentagon or in rural Pennsylvania. Because 9/11 was not only an attack on New York and on the United States. It struck at the heart of the entire world.</p><p>For me personally, New York feels like a second home. I have felt this way ever since I first visited the city, in 1989. New York immediately won my heart − got under my skin even. I can't say exactly why; there's no one reason. It's the combination of dynamism and creativity that gives the city such exceptional energy. It's all the different nationalities that make New York the capital of the world. But perhaps, more than anything, it's the almost tangible tradition of openness and individual freedom, which you feel each time you arrive there. That still impresses me every time I visit.</p><p>But the city never made a deeper impression on me, the New Yorkers never impressed me more, than in the autumn of 2001, a few weeks after 9/11. I was in New York on business and I went to the neighbourhood around Ground Zero. There were still notes and photos hanging everywhere, appealing to people to get in touch. I remember it as if it were yesterday: that incredible sense of unity that held the city together in those weeks. I remember the enormous heaps of rubble where the World Trade Center had stood. I remember the resilience of the people, who despite the pain and despite the grief had already found the courage to look to the future. And what I remember most was the determination of everyone I spoke to, that the terrorists would never be allowed to win.</p><p>The Netherlands shared that determination from day one, because the democratic values that we share must never be surrendered to the forces of blind hate and fundamentalism. This is the reason the United States and the Netherlands, together with other countries, continue in our efforts to safeguard peace and security. To combat terrorism, and to promote the freedom and democratic rights of people worldwide. As we have done since 9/11, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and recently in Libya. It's true, we often face extremely difficult challenges and instant success is rare. And the harsh reality is that terrorism was not defeated immediately after 9/11, as later attacks on Bali, London and Madrid have shown. But we are gaining ground, step by step. Because in the end, tyranny and terrorist violence cannot triumph over people resolved to shape their own destiny.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>We are all 'citizens of everywhere'. We learned that on 9/11. And we are reminded of it forcefully on an anniversary like today. So it is good, and necessary, for us to continue remembering the victims of 9/11. They deserve that − as individuals. And because they remind us that freedom and democracy demand constant vigilance. It is up to us to honour their memory. And staying vigilant is the best possible way to do it. So that something positive can come from the terrible events of that day: for future generations around the world.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
88,"<p> </p><p>Statement by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte at the UN Climate Change Conference 'COP21', Paris, 30 November 2015 </p><p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Today, the world's eyes are once again on Paris. I admire the people of this city for their resilience and determination. This conference shows that − no matter how hard it was hit on that black day a few weeks ago</p><p>– </p><p>la ville lumière ne recule jamais</p><p>. </p><p> </p><p>It's good to be here.</p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>Voltaire − the great French Enlightenment philosopher – once wrote: 'Men argue. Nature acts.' I believe these words hold a truth and a challenge to all of us at this summit. Because the truth is that climate change is nature's active response to modern-day life. </p><p> </p><p>The Kingdom of the Netherlands, both in Europe and the Caribbean, is fully committed to the goal of keeping global warming below two degrees Celsius. It's important to adapt to the effects of climate change. The 2 goals − climate neutrality and climate resilience – go hand in hand. </p><p> </p><p>So how can we achieve those goals? What are the critical success factors? I'll give you 3:</p><p> </p><p>First, every country needs to focus on measurable national targets. Our efforts must lead to a legally binding climate agreement that addresses the causes and effects of climate change. </p><p> </p><p>Second, that agreement needs to be flexible and dynamic. It needs to take account of the great diversity of nations and the developments in each of them. The traditional divide between rich and poor and north and south is no longer all defining. Countries' capabilities change. And it's important that each contributes according to their ability. The Kingdom of the Netherlands takes this responsibility in climate finance seriously. In 2010-2014 we contributed 800 million euro, and Dutch climate finance will continue to grow to 550 million in 2016.</p><p> </p><p>And third, there needs to be a bigger role for companies, consumers, cities and civil society organisations. Climate policy can only work if it penetrates to the deepest roots of our society and people’s behaviour. For that to happen we need every conceivable party to work together – nationally and internationally. </p><p> </p><p>Let me give you a concrete example of a project that the Netherlands has a special connection with: the International Delta Coalition, in which vulnerable urban deltas from around the world share their knowledge and experience. Not only governments, but also companies, knowledge institutions and NGOs. </p><p> </p><p>So, ladies and gentlemen. Let's act.  Let's act together. And let's act now! </p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
89,"<p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>It’s great to be here in our shared House of the Future in the Turbine Hall.</p><p> </p><p>But, if I may be blunt, this visit has of course been overshadowed by the recent dreadful events in Paris. They were a direct attack on everything we stand for. Our values, our democracy and our freedom. In Europe, in the Netherlands, and here in South Africa.</p><p> </p><p>And yet it’'s encouraging, in these dark days, to see how the Netherlands and South Africa are standing side by side with France, in unity and solidarity. Standing together against terrorism. Standing together against barbaric extremists who seek to spread fear and sow divisions. That is the best way we can respond.</p><p> </p><p>It is also encouraging to see how young people here, in the House of the Future, are making plans that will shape their future and the future of South Africa. I’ve just come from a ‘Get in the Ring’ session, where enterprising young people were literally getting into the ring to pitch their ideas. Each one smart and innovative. It was truly inspiring.</p><p> </p><p>In Holland we have a saying: 'The future is for the young'. Well, South Africa’s future is in good hands.</p><p> </p><p>Nelson Mandela once said, 'Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.' He was right. And education and entrepeneurship are a golden combination. It's no coincidence that these are two important pillars of the House of the Future. With initiatives like this, we can equip the next generation 'to change the world', as Mr Mandela said.</p><p> </p><p>As a historian, I know that the future is always built on the past. The same is true of our countries' common future. And considering the close historical ties between South Africa and the Netherlands, that future holds a lot of promise.</p><p> </p><p>I've come to this beautiful country with a large business delegation to fortify and deepen our excellent relationship. Not just the political component, but definitely our economic ties too.</p><p> </p><p>Right now, trade between our countries is worth nearly 3.3 billion euros a year. More than 350 Dutch businesses are active in South Africa, including major multinationals like KLM, Philips, Shell and Unilever. But more and more small and medium-sized enterprises are also doing business here. Together they generate over 100,000 jobs for the South African economy. And there’s room for more.</p><p> </p><p>Today I had a very productive meeting with President Zuma and we decided to step up our cooperation even more. At the meeting, we signed bilateral agreements on a range of topics. And tonight a series of business-to-business agreements are going to be signed as well. My compliments and congratulations to all the companies involved. I'm looking forward to witnessing that special moment.</p><p> </p><p>I believe we need to find ways to maintain the dynamic of the House of the Future. So, I'm delighted to be able to announce the first 'Orange Corners'in South Africa. Orange Corners are places that function as seedbeds of innovation. They bring together young South African entrepreneurs and Dutch start-ups in their search for opportunities in South Africa.</p><p> </p><p>And conversely: the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency has just opened its first office here. Because we see opportunities for more South African investment in the Netherlands.</p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, there is always room for more. More cooperation. More sharing of knowledge and know-how. More growth and more jobs.</p><p> </p><p>Let me close by thanking the House of the Future and all the participants. You have truly inspired me.</p><p> </p><p>I knew it before, but today confirmed it again: South Africa and the Netherlands not only share a history, we also share a future.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p>",2
90,"<p> </p><p>Mr President, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>First of all, Mr President, thank you for inviting me to South Africa and for the warm welcome we received today. Unfortunately, our visit has been overshadowed by the recent dreadful events in Paris. South Africa and the Netherlands share the same sense of outrage and anger at this barbaric assault on freedom.</p><p> </p><p>Our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones. And with the people of Paris, who – despite their devastation – have found strength in standing together with a shared message: no fear. We support that message.</p><p>We will not be ruled by fear.</p><p>We will not be divided.</p><p>That is the best response we can give.</p><p> </p><p>These attacks only underline the importance of countries working together to fight terrorism, challenge hatred and resolve divisions. And the Netherlands and South Africa are already doing precisely that, for example within the Global Counterterrorism Forum.</p><p> </p><p>In fact, we've been working together for decades – in the political, economic and cultural arenas. And it’s all thanks to our shared history and longstanding friendship.</p><p> </p><p>In preparing for this trip, I couldn’t help thinking back to 11 February 1990, when Nelson Mandela was released from prison. I watched the live coverage along with millions of other people all over the world. It was a vibrant moment full of happiness and hope. </p><p> </p><p>And for my generation it was the 2th event in quick succession – after the fall of the Berlin Wall – that made us feel part of world history. It was unforgettable.</p><p> </p><p>Back then, I was a history student at Leiden University. And now, a quarter of a century later, I'm here as prime minister of a country whose ties with South Africa date back hundreds of years. </p><p> </p><p>Many, but not all the chapters in our shared history are good ones.</p><p> </p><p>And that makes us all the more proud and thankful that, in the struggle against apartheid, the Netherlands was able to support the brave men and women who fought for freedom, equality and democracy.</p><p> </p><p>The bonds of friendship and cooperation between our two countries are long-standing, robust and still growing. And that's why I'm here with the Netherlands’ largest-ever trade mission to Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p> </p><p>This underlines the immense Dutch interest in South Africa and the widely-shared belief that our common future holds the promise of prosperity for all. Mr President, the new South Africa is only 21 years old and yet it has made impressive progress in building a strong democracy, a strong society and a strong economy.</p><p> </p><p>But there is still work to be done to ensure that every South African can look to their future, and their children’s future, with confidence. That's no easy task. It takes perseverance, problem-solving and a keen eye for opportunities to improve people’s daily lives.</p><p> </p><p>So I'm pleased we’re continuing our partnership and even stepping up our efforts. We've just signed a number of MoUs that will enhance our cooperation at government level. One of them establishes a joint commission that will further expand and deepen our excellent relations. There are more than 70 Dutch companies in my delegation. They represent important sectors like agriculture, water management, logistics and life sciences. And they are all here for the long term, not for quick wins.</p><p> </p><p>At the moment, 350 Dutch businesses are already active in South Africa, small and medium-sized enterprises as well as multinationals. Together they provide more than 100,000 jobs in this country. </p><p> </p><p>And I can tell you that both the Dutch government and the Dutch business community are convinced that there is room for more. More partnerships. More economic activity between our countries. And as a result: more opportunities for people to shape their own future, and – in doing so – our common future.</p><p> </p><p>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to propose a toast.</p><p> </p><p>To the future. To the wellbeing and prosperity of all South Africans. And to the lasting friendship between our 2 countries and our peoples.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
91,"<p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, </p><p> </p><p>I recently read the story of the Dutch 19-year-old Fleur Jong. She was a top dancer, taking part in national competitions.  Until three years ago, when she got a serious bacterial infection. So serious that she lost both her lower legs and part of eight fingers. Last month, Fleur made her debut in Paralympic athletics at the World Championships.</p><p> </p><p>Now the former dancer is as fast as lightning – on her blades. Fleur Jong is an inspiration. A determined young woman who thinks in terms of possibilities, not limitations. She’s never let herself be beaten − even in the worst times. Her focus is on her sport, not her disability. </p><p> </p><p>Fleur is special, but she’s not unique. Take the 32-year-old Japanese athlete Maya Nakanishi. She lost part of her right leg in an accident at work.  But she didn’t give up.</p><p> </p><p>Soon she was breaking Japanese records in track and field. When she failed to get funding and a new artificial leg for the London Paralympics, she refused to give in.</p><p> </p><p>Maya published a calendar of herself and raised 50,000 dollars. And in 2012 she was there at the starting line in London.</p><p> </p><p>People like Fleur, Maya and the wheelchair basketball players here today underline the importance of sport and of this gathering.  They are an inspiration to us all. So it’s great that we are joined here by Japanese and Dutch schoolchildren, who can see for themselves what it’s like to play sport in a wheelchair.</p><p> </p><p>Boys and girls, I hope today will show you that sport should – and can – be accessible to all. I have every confidence in the future of Paralympic sport, with you as its new ambassadors. </p><p> </p><p>This meeting illustrates the importance that Japan and the Netherlands attach to promoting disabled sports. The wide coverage of Paralympic sports holds great promise for the 2020 Games in Tokyo. I believe it can help us achieve a society where everybody gets the chance to participate.</p><p> </p><p>We think this is important, because sport not only helps create healthy individuals. It also contributes to a healthy society as a whole. Today's clinic and demonstration show that we can learn a lot from each other in the field of disabled sports.</p><p> </p><p>And that leaves me in no doubt that the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games will embrace the principles of 'Sport for all' and 'Accepting one another'. That they will honour the positive attitude shown by Fleur Jong, Maya Nakanishi and the wheelchair basketball players here today. People who think in terms of possibilities, not limitations.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
92,"<p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Thank you for your warm welcome. It's a pleasure to be here at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. A fitting place to talk about a crucial issue. </p><p> Today, I'd like to tell you about two young Dutchmen who went to San Francisco to study in 2011. There, they created the 'Hack 100'. A list of 100 high-tech businesses whose websites they checked for security vulnerabilities. They reported any problems directly to the companies, one of which was Facebook. Alex Rice, Head of Product Security, was impressed and decided to invest in the project. This led to the creation of HackerOne. The company has now located and resolved more than 12,000 security vulnerabilities on the websites of major players like Yahoo, Airbnb and Twitter. Making the internet safer as a result. It's a fantastic example of Dutch-US cooperation. One of those young Dutchmen, Michiel Prins, is taking part in this trade mission, together with some of his colleagues.</p><p>Every day these people deal with the focus of this seminar: the impact of emerging technologies on financial services and cyber security. It's about more than one flaw on one site. The internet shapes our daily lives. Everything from our social contacts to our security and infrastructure. It has given us a lot. Like access to information anywhere in the world. And new, smart ways of doing business that increase economic growth and employment. But it has also brought risks.</p><p>We must remember that everything - including vital sectors like energy, telecommunications, banking and security - is linked to the internet. So society can't function without network availability. And that makes it vulnerable. Disrupt the system and you disrupt society itself.</p><p> </p><p>The internet also offers criminals opportunities to 'go global'. We've all heard media reports about cyber crime and its consequences. More and more companies and financial institutions are the target of sophisticated cyber attacks. Causing serious economic damage. That's why tackling cyber crime - or, better yet, promoting cyber security - is vital if we want to safeguard the internet.</p><p> </p><p>International cooperation between governments and the private sector is an essential part of this.The internet transcends national borders. Countries must share information and fight cyber crime together.</p><p> </p><p>In the Netherlands, public-private cooperation is a big priority. A successful example of this approach is the Dutch Information Sharing and Analysis Centre which tackles cyber attacks on the financial sector. And it's working: in 2014 the damage caused by payment traffic fraud in the Netherlands was half that in 2013. </p><p> Cyber crime is a problem for major multinationals and institutions too. And it's often startups that can offer the quick and flexible solutions needed. That's why, in the Netherlands, we're seeing more and more big businesses and banks joining forces with startups.</p><p> </p><p>I don't think it's a coincidence that 2 young Dutchmen helped found HackerOne. The Netherlands and Flanders are world-leaders when it comes to creating and using innovative digital technologies. Our payment systems are some of the most advanced in the world. So is our IT infrastructure. It's no accident that the Netherlands is home to the world's second-largest internet exchange point. For several years now, our region has been home to a booming cyber-security and FinTech startup scene.</p><p> </p><p>At the same time, Atlanta is gaining a reputation as the Silicon Valley of FinTech and cyber security. Hence the nickname 'Transaction Alley'. And institutions like world-renowned Georgia Tech are providing the knowledge to make this happen.</p><p> </p><p>It's vital that we bring together expertise from the Netherlands, Flanders and Atlanta.</p><p> </p><p>The Dutch-Flemish region is a digital information and logistics hub. Atlanta is the FinTech and cyber-security centre of the world. All have large, tech-savvy workforces with lots to offer each other. And that could lead to new innovations, economic growth and jobs. But it goes deeper than that. It's about enhancing our safety and security. It's about reducing terrorist threats. It's about privacy and quality of life. That's what makes today's discussion so crucial.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
93,"<p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>Think of Atlanta and you think of Coca-Cola. Think of the Netherlands and you think of Heineken. Both are great export products and are among the most famous brand names in the world. I must admit that one is a bit more famous than the other. But I think we can agree that we both know about beverages!</p><p> </p><p>I mention these companies for a reason. They are excellent examples of the growing cooperation between the Dutch-Flemish region and Atlanta. Heineken has a distribution centre here in the Port of Savannah. And Coca-Cola Enterprises just expanded its operations in the Netherlands by opening one of Europe's most advanced production sites in Dongen. </p><p> </p><p>But beverages are not the only thing we have in common. We are on different continents, with an ocean between us. We might seem to be worlds apart, but we are not. And the American entrepreneurs here today know that better than anyone. We very much appreciate your investment in the Netherlands and your selecting the Netherlands-Flanders business delta to create a foothold in Europa.</p><p> </p><p>The Dutch and Flemish businesses on this trade mission are equally interested in technology matchmaking and doing business in the US. That's because business is in our DNA and has been for centuries. We've always looked beyond our borders.</p><p>And today - to paraphrase Ray Charles - we've got Georgia on our mind.</p><p> </p><p>In fact, we've got each other on our minds, and that's why the economic ties between the Netherlands, Flanders and Atlanta are growing. The value of exports from Georgia to the Netherlands is 850 million dollars a year. And exports in the other direction are worth 900 million dollars a year. That's a total export value of nearly two billion dollars.</p><p> </p><p>It makes sense that ties between our regions are growing closer. Just as Georgia is a gateway to the US, the Netherlands and Flanders are the gateway to Europe. </p><p> You have the great port of Savannah; we have the great ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp. These are crucial logistics hubs in the US and Europe.</p><p> </p><p>But our regions are also leaders in information technology. And in this field, the sky's the limit. I recently heard someone say that digital development is the circulatory system of the new economy. There's a great need for smart ideas and innovations. In the Netherlands and Flanders, we know that. And in Atlanta, you know it better than anyone. Your city has been called the new Silicon Valley of FinTech and cyber security.</p><p> </p><p>Amsterdam has also proven to be fertile ground for startups. Take the software company Backbase, a member of our trade delegation. Backbase creates smart customer interactions for mobile apps, and has long outgrown its startup status. This week they are opening an office in Atlanta.</p><p> </p><p>And that's only one of many examples. Startups are springing up all over the Netherlands, not only in Amsterdam. This is thanks to our innovative mind-set and enterprising spirit. The Netherlands is home to leading technology clusters, with world-class R&D in the fields of agrifood, life sciences and health, chemicals and high-tech. In these clusters, business, academia and government work together in a truly unique way, creating a climate for innovation. And we have an educated and flexible workforce with an open, international and pro-business mentality.</p><p> </p><p>But you've already noticed that. Many of you have been active in the Netherlands for many years and you continue to grow your business and expand your operations. </p><p> This past year, we've seen new companies from Georgia starting operations in the Netherlands, like Inmark, Kids II, Speakeasy and Spanx. And Dutch companies like KLM and BCD are opening locations in Georgia.</p><p> </p><p>That's exciting. And the innovative power of the Netherlands, Flanders and Georgia offers many more opportunities in FinTech, information security and logistics. </p><p> That's why I'm happy you're all here today. My colleagues from the NFIA and I will listen carefully to your needs. We want to know what you need to keep your business booming in Europe, so that we can provide a pro-business investment climate and maintain our leading position. In the words of the legendary Yogi Berra - may he rest in peace: 'when you arrive at a fork in the road, take it'. Well, we plan to take it.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p>",2
94,"<p>Mayor Reed, Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p> It's a pleasure and an honour to be at this fantastic venue this evening. </p><p> I studied history at university. So a dinner at the Atlanta History Center really appealed to me. This impressive building radiates a love of history and respect for the past. </p><p> The Atlanta History Center has plenty of stories to tell. This city and region have a rich and varied history. You can see that from the many exhibitions in this building. </p><p> They cover everything from the American Civil War and the film classic Gone with the Wind, to the 1996 Olympic Games. </p><p> And I saw it for myself yesterday, when I visited the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site. The story of Dr King’s fight for freedom and justice is still an inspiration to us all. Freedom and justice are values we promote worldwide. They bind our countries together. They form the basis of our friendship and our political, military and economic partnerships. </p><p> The Dutch, Americans and Flemish have a no-nonsense approach to doing business. Our focus is on solutions, not problems. This shared mentality has created excellent trade ties, which are more than 4 centuries old. And we’re still going strong. What’s more, there are lots of new opportunities. That’s why we're working to make trade between Europe and the US easier, with the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. </p><p> Trade and investment between my country and the US have created almost 24,000 jobs in Georgia and the Netherlands. For years the Netherlands has been among the top 5 foreign investors in the US. And the US, for its part, is the biggest foreign direct investor in the Netherlands. </p><p> But there's always room for improvement. And that’s why Minister President Bourgeois and I are here today. We have brought along a delegation of Dutch and Flemish IT and logistics companies. And they are all very interested in exploring business and technology matchmaking opportunities. </p><p> The reason for Flanders and the Netherlands joining forces on this trade mission is obvious. Not only do we share a language, culture and history: the Dutch-Flemish delta region is considered the ‘gateway to Europe’. This is thanks to the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport and the region’s excellent roads and waterways. And we have a counterpart in Georgia. Atlanta’s international airport is a major hub for domestic air traffic, and more than 12,300 logistics companies have branches in the region. Georgia is one of America's fastest-growing states in terms of its economy and population. And Atlanta is its beating heart. </p><p> But there's more. One of the most famous products to emerge from this city is Coca Cola. For years, pharmacist John Pemberton sold a popular alcoholic drink. When prohibition came into force in Atlanta in 1885, he replaced the wine in his drink with sugar syrup. It's a story which really speaks to me. Because it shows the power of inventiveness and flexibility. Pemberton didn’t see an obstacle in prohibition. He saw an opportunity. And then created the most famous soft drink in the world. </p><p> </p><p> This was more than a century ago. But Pemberton’s innovative spirit lives on. </p><p> Atlanta is gaining a reputation around the world as the Silicon Valley of financial technologies and information security. More than 70 per cent of all online payments in the US go through Georgia’s 'Transaction Alley'. </p><p> Innovative FinTech and cyber-security startups are also sprouting up across the Netherlands and Flanders. In fact, Amsterdam is quickly becoming one of the FinTech capitals of the world. Just look at companies like Backbase and Parkmobile: high-tech businesses leading the global digital applications sector. </p><p> Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p> With all this exciting potential, maybe we should ask ourselves why we didn't visit sooner. The innovative power of the Netherlands, Flanders and Georgia offers exciting opportunities in financial technologies, information security and logistics. </p><p> I'm looking forward to a fascinating evening. Please take the opportunity to get to know each other, hatch some plans and make a few deals that will benefit us all. </p><p> Thank you.</p>",2
95,"<p> </p><p>Governor, </p><p> First Lady of Georgia, </p><p> Brigadier General, </p><p> Commissioner, </p><p> Your Excellencies, </p><p> ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>70 years ago, Europe and the Netherlands were liberated by brave, young Americans. 70 years ago, those courageous soldiers put their lives on the line for peace and security on the other side of the world. 70 years ago, far too many of them died a long way from home.</p><p> </p><p>This May on Memorial Day I was at the American cemetery in Margraten, a solemn and moving place in the hills of the southern Netherlands. Today, more than 8,000 white marble crosses bear silent witness to the sacrifices that were made.</p><p>People still in the flush of youth, like Private First Class Robert Long of Worth County, Georgia. These sons and daughters answered the call to fight for a country they didn’t know and for people they’d never met. They left their homes, families and loved ones behind. Families who waited in vain for them to return.  </p><p> </p><p>As always, that visit made a deep impression on me. In 2005 the entire Dutch government attended the memorial with President Bush. And this year too, there were veterans and surviving relatives there whose advanced age may prevent them from visiting the graves of their loved ones again. But as I said to them: the people of Europe will never forget them. We will keep saying their names and telling their stories.</p><p> </p><p>All the graves at Margraten have been adopted by people who live close by. By families and school classes. There’s even a waiting list. Year in and year out, these people tend the graves. They write to the families of the fallen, and arrange visits back and forth. And they do it out of respect and gratitude to our liberators.</p><p> </p><p>It is an honour to pay my respects to them on American soil today. The Netherlands will be forever grateful for the sacrifices that Americans made to secure our freedom. Today, we remember the fallen and honour the men and women willing to give their lives to make the world a safer place - in the past, and today. Men and women like Airman 1st Class Kcey Ruiz from Georgia, who was killed in a plane crash in Afghanistan, only this Friday. Our thoughts are with her family.</p><p> </p><p>The courage of these heroes still inspires us today. It inspires us to keep working for peace and security worldwide. Just as the United States and the Netherlands have fought shoulder to shoulder in Korea, Afghanistan and in the battle against ISIS.</p><p> </p><p>Our joint efforts symbolise the age-old friendship between our two countries. A friendship based on shared values. On our deep-rooted faith in democracy, freedom, justice and human rights.</p><p> </p><p>Seventy years later, freedom is still not a given for everyone. Thousands of refugees are knocking on Europe's door because they fear for their lives in their own country. We have a duty to our liberators to keep working for peace worldwide. Together we must work to achieve the liberty that General Eisenhower called for.</p><p> </p><p>On the eve of D-Day, the general encouraged the troops with his Order of the Day. He said, 'The free men of the world are marching together to victory. I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and skill in battle. '</p><p> </p><p>The courage, devotion and skill of those free men still resonate 70 years later, in the hills of the southern Netherlands and here today. Thanks to them we stand here in freedom.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
96,"<p> </p><p>Mr President, esteemed colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>On 8 January this year I stood among thousands of people on Dam Square in Amsterdam. It was one day after the cowardly attack in Paris on the editorial staff of Charlie Hebdo. One day after the cold-blooded murder of twelve innocent people. People around the world were deeply affected by these events. 'Je suis Charlie'. </p><p> We said it in Amsterdam too.</p><p>It was an evening I'll never forget. There we stood, united and resolute. Men and women from all corners of the earth, young and old, people of every religious background. And our message to terrorists was loud and clear. We are different and yet we are one. We are the majority. And we will not let you divide us. </p><p> 'Hands off our freedom', were my words that night. And I can still feel the emotion of that moment.</p><p> </p><p>Da'esh and violent extremism are not other people's problems. Not only are countries like Syria and Iraq being completely destabilised, this threat also spreads insecurity and fuels tensions in our own communities. That is why the Netherlands is and will remain so actively involved in the fight against Da'esh and in combating violent extremism. We have an obligation to help foster international peace and stability. And we cannot take our own freedom for granted. So we stand shoulder to shoulder with many other countries, in the region and beyond, in the coalition against Da'esh.</p><p>Dutch F-16s are involved in the air campaign against Da'esh targets on a daily basis. We have sent military trainers and equipment to Iraq to train the Iraqi army and the Peshmerga. We are also providing emergency aid, implementing counter-messaging strategies and working on capacity building. It's not an easy task, but it is crucial. When people are being beheaded and ancient heritage sites are being destroyed with sledgehammers, we must respond. And we must respond there where it is happening. </p><p> </p><p>A second track the Netherlands is following is prevention. In our own country we've developed a broad programme, focusing not only on potential foreign terrorist fighters, but on parents, schools, local government and the local police too.</p><p>If we can give young - often impressionable - people the prospect of a good future, they will be less drawn to extremist groups. The idea is that intervening early in their immediate social environment is the best way to stop young people being tempted to go off to fight abroad. Any kind of positive and moderate influence can help.</p><p>Our approach is inclusive where possible, but repressive where necessary. Our international efforts include working with partners in the Global Counterterrorism Forum. The Forum is the primary platform where countries can share knowledge and information in order to prevent terrorism. A few days ago the Netherlands became co-chair of the Forum, affirming our long-term commitment. The Forum complements and collaborates with the UN and other organisations. Over the past year there's been a big focus on how to prevent potential foreign terrorist fighters from travelling abroad. And how to deal with those who come back.</p><p> </p><p>The fact is that violent extremism and terrorist groups like Da'esh, Al-Qa'ida, Jabhat al Nusra and Boko Haram are constantly evolving. This is not a static threat, and it will not simply disappear. The international community cannot afford to sit back. We must be vigilant and persistent. We must continue to make it clear that we are not fighting a religion.</p><p>We are fighting terrorists who carry out attacks and whose barbarism knows no bounds. For that reason too, it's good that we're meeting here today. </p><p> The Netherlands remains fully committed to the task ahead. Freedom is our inspiration. Resolve is our weapon. And together we will succeed in pushing back the terrorist threat.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
97,"<p>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, </p><p>President Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, 'When peace has been broken anywhere, the peace of all countries everywhere is in danger'. These words capture the spirit of today's summit.  </p><p>We're here to renew our commitment to the UN's aim of promoting peace and security worldwide. I'd like to thank President Obama and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for this important initiative. We face big challenges and we have high expectations of UN peace missions. So we must make sure we keep supplying the UN with enough people and resources. After all, we are the UN.</p><p>The past few years have brought war and conflict very close to home. The violence, the enormous refugee flows: we cannot ignore what is happening.</p><p>The Kingdom of the Netherlands has a long-standing tradition of active involvement in international affairs. That commitment explains our candidacy for a seat on the UN Security Council in 2017 and 2018. Since 1947 our country has been involved in more than sixty UN-mandated missions in over thirty countries, deploying more than 125,000 men and women. The belief underlying our contributions to these missions has always been that in many conflict situations, it is only the UN that can legitimately intervene. </p><p>That belief also prompted us to host a European prelude to this summit in Amsterdam last February. More than forty countries attended and reaffirmed their support for UN peace missions and how to make these missions more effective. The Netherlands believes the basis should be a clear mandate and an integrated approach. Regional partnerships and better cooperation with local communities are essential.</p><p>The Netherlands will remain fully committed to peacekeeping in the years ahead. </p><p>Let me be specific:</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, the importance of UN peace missions is beyond question. One conflict, in one country or one continent, affects us all. But to stay effective, we must keep working, keep innovating and keep focusing. </p><p>The Netherlands stands ready to play its part.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
98,"<p>Esteemed colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Sigrid Kaag is the senior Dutch diplomat at the United Nations.</p><p>She led the mission to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons and is currently a UN envoy in Lebanon.</p><p>Next to her office door is a sign saying: ‘men to the left, because women are always right’.</p><p>I won’t comment on whether she’s right about that.</p><p>But it’s true that all too often, conference rooms and offices like Sigrid Kaag’s are occupied by men.</p><p>And around the world, far too many women aren’t free to make their own decisions about work, attending school, who they marry or even what clothes to wear.</p><p>Twenty years ago ministers from all over the world came together in Beijing to talk about this issue.</p><p>Since then, some progress has been made, but the ultimate goal – equal rights and opportunities for men and women – is still a long way off.</p><p>That’s why it’s so important that we’re here today.</p><p>Because in leaving the potential of women and girls untapped, we are missing out on opportunities for development, justice and peace.</p><p>That’s why the Netherlands remains committed to this agenda – both at home and internationally.</p><p>Worldwide, women’s participation in the work force has been stuck at fifty-five per cent for two decades.</p><p>By comparison, the figure for men is currently eighty per cent.</p><p>Not only is this a gross injustice to women and their families, it’s also an expensive loss to companies, governments and the world economy.</p><p>We have to do better.</p><p>Today we’re here to tell each other what we’re doing to change this and what the current situation is in our own countries.</p><p>When it comes to gender equality, the Netherlands ranks among the top 10 in the UN index for 2015.</p><p>More women than men follow higher education in the Netherlands.</p><p>And they’re getting better results. </p><p>That’s good news.</p><p>But we can’t afford to rest on our laurels.</p><p>Because the fact remains that women in our country still earn sixteen per cent less than men for the same work.</p><p>Seventy-seven per cent of women in the Netherlands work part-time.</p><p>So many women aren’t economically independent.</p><p>The Dutch government is therefore committed to increasing women’s economic independence and financial self-sufficiency, especially the low-skilled and functionally illiterate.</p><p>To this end, we’re working with local authorities, businesses and educational institutes to offer opportunities like job interview training.</p><p>Equality between women and men is also a guiding principle of our foreign policy and development efforts.</p><p>Because we know that gender equality provides a basis for stability and economic prosperity.</p><p>We work closely with governments, businesses and civil society organisations around the world to achieve this goal.</p><p>We also work with human rights defenders standing up for equal rights for women.</p><p>We help protect their freedom of speech, assembly and association so they can advance this cause.</p><p>In January 2016, my government is launching a programme called Funding Leadership and Opportunities for Women. </p><p>Its aim is to support women’s economic and political participation and combat violence against women and girls in low-income and low middle-income countries.</p><p>It will be the largest fund of its kind in the world.</p><p>An important part of our international efforts is advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights. </p><p>For women worldwide to have a voice and economic opportunities, they need to be able to make their own choices about sexuality and family planning.</p><p>So in 2016 the Netherlands is launching another major fund to advance these rights around the world.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, we can’t afford to waste the potential of half the world’s population.</p><p>I don’t know if women are always right, but they should at least have the same opportunities as men to prove it. </p><p>Thank you.</p>",6
99,"<p>Mr Secretary-General, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>One of your illustrious predecessors, Mr Secretary-General, once said, ‘Never look down to test the ground before taking your next step; only he who keeps his eye fixed on the far horizon will find the right road.’</p><p>These wise words by Dag Hammarskjöld have never been more fitting than they are today.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, the international community fixed its gaze on the horizon.</p><p>The Millennium Development Goals showed an unprecedented level of ambition.</p><p>At the time, many wondered whether we needed a reality check.</p><p>Were the goals really achievable? </p><p>We now know the answer to that question.</p><p>The MDGs have been a big success, even though there are major regional differences and not every goal was reached precisely as intended.</p><p>So what has the world achieved in the past fifteen years? Well, among other things:</p><p>Of course, there is still a lot to be done.</p><p>But here, on the eve of the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda and the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals for 2016 to 2030, the success of the MDGs should give us confidence in the next leap forward.</p><p>The MDGs have taught us many lessons over the past fifteen years. Today I would like to mention three.</p><p>Three lessons we should take to heart as we move ahead with the SDGs.</p><p>First: by working together, in a collective effort, we can make a difference.</p><p>We can achieve great things if we set our minds, our means and our hearts to it.</p><p>Second: goals like eradicating poverty, achieving gender equality and giving the poor better health care and sanitation should go hand in hand with multi-stakeholder involvement, sound economic principles and sustainable development.</p><p>There really is no substitute for an integrated approach.</p><p>And third: we must have more private sector involvement in long-term financing, in public-private partnerships and in projects on the ground. Dutch companies and the Dutch government already have a solid track record.</p><p>Last year, more than sixty partners signed the Post-2015 Charter, a corporate initiative that brings together Dutch businesses, universities and other organisations that have already committed to the agenda we’re discussing at this summit.</p><p>So on behalf of the Netherlands, I applaud the outcome of the recent Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa.</p><p>New and innovative partnerships and financing arrangements will be key factors for success in the fifteen years of hard work that lie ahead of us.</p><p>So what does private sector involvement look like in practice?</p><p>It could look like the ambition Heineken has formulated for its breweries in Africa and the Middle East, to source sixty per cent of all its ingredients locally.</p><p>The Netherlands is supporting this effort by offering training for farmers. And it’s working.</p><p>In Burundi, for example, this partnership has already enabled 18,000 farmers to make a steady income by supplying this world-famous Dutch brewer.</p><p>It could also look like the Health Insurance Fund, a public-private initiative supported by some of the largest Dutch insurance companies. In 2014 alone, the fund provided health and agricultural insurance for 460,000 people in sub-Saharan countries.</p><p>Sixty per cent of them were women. </p><p>But it could also look like the Amsterdam Initiative against Malnutrition, or AIM, which was launched in 2009. </p><p>AIM brings together many partners: the Dutch government and NGOs, multinationals in food and chemicals like Unilever, DSM and AkzoNobel, and agricultural knowledge institutions like Wageningen University and Research Centre.</p><p>AIM’s focus is on making good-quality and nutritious food available to as many vulnerable people as possible, using a market-based approach. The bottom line is simple: developed and run by 20 African and Dutch partners, AIM’s project portfolio now provides 26 million people with better access to nutritious foods.</p><p>The market-based approach is an important driver behind AIM, and I believe it sets an example for the future. </p><p>Within the framework of the SDGs and corporate social responsibility, many individual firms are expressing a growing desire for more effective public-private partnerships.</p><p>More and more SMEs are eager to follow in the sustainable footsteps of multinationals that have led the way. </p><p>They believe the ‘S ’in SDG offers opportunities for investment and innovation. It’s up to governments and the UN to facilitate, stimulate and make sure that the legal and economic frameworks are in good working order.</p><p>And I’m confident that if we do this and keep on working together, we can unleash far more trade and investment in poor countries, moving the needle further from ‘charitable’ to ‘profitable’ in the years ahead.</p><p>Our commitment to jointly promoting development, in the framework of the UN, is one of the main reasons why the Kingdom of the Netherlands is seeking a seat on the UN Security Council for the 2017 to 2018 term.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Netherlands is fully committed to making the next leap forward.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",2
100,"<p> </p><p>Mr Chief Minister, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>It’s a great pleasure to be here this evening, on my first official trip to India, and my first visit to Mumbai. It’s good to see so many of you here, in the country’s economic capital. With me is the biggest Dutch trade delegation to visit India in recent times. I’m joined by representatives of eighty Dutch businesses, both large and small. They’re led by Hans de Boer, chairman of the largest employers’ association in the Netherlands. </p><p> </p><p>By 'recent times' I mean the last couple of decades. Because back in the early 17th century, many such delegations came to India from the Dutch Republic. In fact, some were even bigger than this one.</p><p> </p><p>Back then Dutch ships roamed the world’s oceans looking for trade. One of their ports of call was in India, where over time they set up a dozen trading posts. In some places, like Madras, those trading stations were active for nearly two centuries. Many traces of that common cultural heritage still remain today.</p><p> </p><p>Going back only 1 century, many modern Dutch firms set up operations here. They've done so well and become so integrated that many locals don’t even know that Philips and Unilever have Dutch roots. They're seen as Indian companies.</p><p> </p><p>That's a good example of how flexible and pragmatic Dutch companies are. They can adjust to local circumstances without risking their core values and skills. And they often show great foresight. Long before Prime Minister Modi called on global investors to 'Make in India', Dutch firms were operating here. Unilever soaps were first produced in Mumbai in 1934, and the first Philips lightbulbs in Kolkata in 1938.</p><p> </p><p>So 'Make in India' is close to our hearts. It played a big role in the discussions I had yesterday in Delhi with Prime Minister Modi and with CEOs of leading Indian and Dutch companies.</p><p> </p><p>Dutch companies are keen to invest more in India. They're also excited about the Modi government's reform programme, with its ambitious goals to transform and modernise the Indian economy.</p><p> </p><p>I told the Prime Minister that the Netherlands is eager to help achieve these goals. We can partner India in a wide range of areas. From helping clean up rivers to setting up agricultural centres of excellence. And offering water management expertise, for example to the state of Maharashtra.</p><p> </p><p>We have great expertise in these fields. Dutch firms work on projects like this all round the world. Like advising the US government after hurricane Katrina and helping the city of New York improve its flood protection. And expanding Hong Kong Airport into the sea, creating islands off the coast of Dubai and protecting the city of Jakarta from rising water levels.</p><p> </p><p>We hope to extend this kind of partnership with India, as well. We have a good foundation – our bilateral economic relations are already strong and wide-ranging. We are major trading partners. Both India and the Netherlands are among the top five foreign investors in each other’s country, and our mutual trade amounts to almost six billion euros.</p><p> </p><p>Our business community feels the excitement of a resurgent, fast-growing India, and wants to be part of that bright future. And more and more successful Indian companies are taking to the global stage. They’re finding the Netherlands an excellent launch pad as a European base. In recent years, over 200 Indian companies have set up operations in the Netherlands. My country hosts one of the largest populations of people of Indian origin in Europe – second only to the UK. We hope that many Indian companies will follow. Because they bring not only new investments and new jobs, but also new knowledge, insights and expertise to our country.</p><p> </p><p>Growing bilateral trade and investment also pay social and cultural dividends. Take the exhibition of beautiful paintings by Lita Cabellut that I opened earlier today. Or the fine initiative we saw this afternoon at the Holland Village, where former Dutch hockey champions are promoting a campaign to restore India to the top of the international hockey rankings. The aim is to recruit a million new young hockey players.</p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>Let me conclude by saying how happy I am to be here at such an exciting time for India. The American writer Mark Twain once said, 'India is the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend, and the great grandmother of tradition'. India indeed has a rich history, but it also has a very bright future. I’m delighted that the Netherlands can play a part in shaping that future.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you</p><p> </p>",3
101,"<p>Secretary-General, excellencies, ministers, deputy-ministers,</p><p>Today it is my honour to welcome you all to Paris and, as prime minister of the Netherlands, to chair this annual OECD Ministerial Council Meeting. I'd like to offer a warm welcome to my esteemed colleagues and vice-chairs from the Czech Republic, France and Korea. And let me thank you, Secretary-General Gurría, for your hospital and my congratulations with your third term as Secretary-General of OECD. We often call on people to work beyond 65, but you have taken that very seriously. Under your leadership the OECD plays a vital role in giving governments and businesses the knowledge and statistics they need to develop policies and take decisions that benefit us all.</p><p>The Netherlands first chaired the MCM in 1964, in a bipolar world at the height of the Cold War. It was a time when the global market place was little more than national economies competing with each other. Our second time was in 1991, a few years after Perestroika and the fall of the Berlin Wall. In Europe, the key priority at that time was warp-speed economic integration. But big economies like China and India were slowly entering the world market too. Integration changed the world's production and trade patterns forever. We know that all too well now, after a global crisis that underscored how interconnected the global economy has become. And it is the magnitude of these changes, and all the opportunities and risks they bring, that we are dealing with today.</p><p>As the emerging economies' significance and integration into the world economy grows, so the OECD's importance grows too. After all, in today's world, well-functioning markets and free-flowing international trade and investment determine the prosperity and wellbeing of more and more people.</p><p>The good news is that we are finally recovering from the crisis. And I do hope that the OECD Economic Outlook that is being presented here today will show other encouraging signs of recovery. But to speed things up and pave the way for new growth and new jobs, it's essential to raise investment at all levels. I'm glad this Ministerial Council Meeting is focusing on that problem, because investment was hit hard by the crisis, and its recovery has been sluggish. In advanced economies, investment has declined by 20 per cent, on average, compared with pre-crisis forecasts. That's a serious amount, and it raises serious questions that need serious answers.</p><p>On the positive side, investment conditions are quite favourable. Interest rates are at an all-time low in many countries. Big companies, particularly, are holding large amounts of cash and hesitating to make new investments. The question we face today is: how do we unlock those resources to create new and sustainable economic growth that generates the new jobs we so badly need? We can't just wave a magic wand, but there are several things that government and business can do to help. One is to expand public-private partnerships, which are enjoying more and more success in various countries and have led to more investment across a wide range of sectors. Another one of course is structural reform, which is the trademark of OECD recommendations.</p><p>To fuel the discussion even further, let me highlight two other issues that I believe are key to today's topics.</p><p>First: Investment, whether domestic or foreign, financed privately or publicly, will only pay off in an enabling environment. That means all countries need to pay attention to good governance, the rule of law, legal certainty, anti-corruption measures, a level playing field and a well functioning market, without too much red tape. All these elements help foster a climate in which everyone can confidently participate in the economy: investors at home and abroad, consumers and savers, local companies and foreign enterprises.</p><p>Second, we must have a keen eye for sustainability and innovation as we work to boost investment. Not only because it's a clear necessity, but also because it provides many promising business opportunities. Take climate change and the need for renewable energy. Take demographic ageing, the fast-growing digital economy or the challenge of how to feed nine billion people by 2050. These are just a few examples that illustrate the need for new, innovative and future-proof solutions. Sustainability and responsible business conduct are not simply optional extras anymore - they're a business case we can't ignore.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have a lot of work ahead of us. But it will be worth it. Because at global level this meeting provides an excellent opportunity to have an interactive, fact-based discussion. We need to consider how best to unlock new investment for sustainable growth and jobs. I'm sure that will motivate all of us to make this Ministerial Council Meeting a great success. I wish you many useful discussions and an inspiring conference focussing on investment, investment and investment. </p><p>Thank you.</p>",7
102,"<p> </p><p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>Welcome to the Netherlands and welcome to The Hague.</p><p> </p><p>Bill Gates once said, 'The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.' It’s a fitting metaphor. The town square is where we meet and talk to each other, and buy and sell. But there are also cheats and pickpockets about.</p><p> </p><p>The internet makes the global local: the entire world is a mouse-click away. There are plenty of opportunities, but there are threats too. And they are harder to manage than the dangers you find in the average town square. Because the global town square is virtual. It’s enormous. And it’s getting bigger. In 1992 there were a million internet users. Today it’s three billion and counting. The internet has changed our entire way of life. Information, media, our social contacts and the economy – we rely on the World Wide Web for all of this now. In many ways, that’s a good thing. But it also brings new forms of dependency and new security risks. Take cybercrime: the likely annual cost of cybercrime to the global economy is more than 400 billion dollars.</p><p> </p><p>So there is a lot at stake. We need to invest in security so that legitimate users will benefit and criminals will think twice. And we want to fully realise the internet’s innovative and economic potential. So I’m delighted that so many of you have come to The Hague. And I’m glad to see that you represent the full spectrum of interests, from countries and businesses to civil society organisations. Because we all need to work together as partners to make sure the internet remains free, open and secure. </p><p> </p><p>This is an important topic for the Netherlands. Because the Netherlands is an internet hub and a gateway to the Web. We have the fastest internet connections in the world.</p><p> </p><p>We have a flourishing creative industry, with lots of ICT talent, app developers and start-ups. We are also home to companies like Google and Huawei, which have offices and investments in our country.</p><p> </p><p>We have something worth defending. So the Netherlands will continue investing in our internet infrastructure, knowledge infrastructure, cyber security and cyber diplomacy.</p><p> </p><p>I want to emphasise that. Not least in the light of our candidacy for a seat on the UN Security Council for the 2017 to 2018 period.</p><p> </p><p>The internet works by connecting people, businesses and countries. We want to safeguard that connectivity and we have to do that by working together. That is what this conference is all about. </p><p> </p><p>For the next two days, you will be focusing on the dilemmas of cyberspace. The internet raises questions that aren’t always easy to answer. Security versus privacy. Economic opportunities versus cyber security. Protecting internet freedom versus safeguarding national security. And opinions differ on these important issues. So there is plenty to talk about in the next two days. And we hope to come up with specific agreements and solutions. For example, we will look at the scope for norms of state conduct in cyberspace.</p><p> </p><p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>The internet offers countless opportunities in every area, including economic development. But its reliability must be beyond doubt. We want our global town square to be vibrant and to flourish. We want it to be a place where people feel safe. That is the goal of the GCCS and that is why you have come to The Hague. I wish you a successful conference.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p>",5
103,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for being here today. </p><p>The reason for my visit to Australia is the terrible fate of flight MH17. This was a tragedy that should never have happened. 298 passengers and crew members lost their lives. Among them were 38 Australians. Our thoughts are with the victims, their loved ones, relatives and friends. </p><p>We in the Netherlands have been overwhelmed by the tremendous support we received from you and from so many other Australians in the aftermath of the disaster. Australians who continue to be involved in one way or another today. </p><p>I would like to thank you most sincerely, on behalf of the Dutch government and on behalf of your Dutch counterparts, for everything you have done. Your efforts and perseverance have been invaluable in helping us to retrieve and identify the victims’ remains and belongings. And also in our efforts to identify and bring to justice the perpetrators of this terrible crime. </p><p>Thanks to your tireless work, we have succeeded in identifying and repatriating many victims and their belongings. </p><p>Some of you are involved in investigating the cause of the downing of flight MH17 – a vital part of our efforts to obtain justice for the victims and their families. Many of you have worked under very difficult conditions at or near the crash site. </p><p>This tragedy has struck our countries deeply. It has also brought us closer than ever before. We are united in grief. </p><p> </p><p>Our two countries, together with Malaysia, will remain committed to completing the daunting task of identifying and bringing home all the victims and their possessions, of establishing the cause of the tragedy, and of bringing those responsible to justice. We will not rest until this work is done. Last week conditions allowed a small team to visit the crash site. They found remains of victims, which will be transferred to the Netherlands following the usual ceremonial protocol. We will continue to take every opportunity to go to the site. </p><p>Next Monday we will have a National Day of Remembrance in the Netherlands. We will commemorate all the victims whose lives ended so abruptly. We will also pay tribute to all those who have contributed to the repatriation mission and the investigations. </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me once again express my deep appreciation for your hard work in the aftermath of the MH17 tragedy. I know that we will carry on with this important work in the same spirit of close friendship.</p>",0
104,"<p>Selamat datang! [welkom]</p><p>It's a great pleasure to be here in this beautiful part of Kuala Lumpur. Although I greatly value this opportunity to meet you, this is a sad occasion.</p><p>Like the Netherlands Malaysia has known an immense tragedy recently. Not only the downing of MH17, but also the disappearance of MH370.</p><p>My main purpose in visiting Malaysia is to express my sympathy and my gratitude to the Malaysian authorities for their assistance and cooperation in the aftermath of flight MH17, and to ensure further close and constructive collaboration.</p><p>I realise that this recent collaboration in the political and legal field has a solid basis in the many years of strong economic bonds between Malaysia and the Netherlands. So I consider this meeting with you the business community and members of the MDBC an integral part of my visit.</p><p>Your performance contributes to a profile in Malaysia of a country that can be trusted. If the disaster affected you directly or indirectly I would like to offer you my deepest sympathy. </p><p> And I would like to express my admiration for your resilience. </p><p>The Dutch Malaysian business community is part of a long history of Dutch enterprise in Malaysia. It is vibrant and successful. Dutch entrepreneurs have been in this country for 160 years - 8 generations.</p><p>Long experience and know-how do not go unnoticed. MDBC is known as one of the most active and successful councils of its kind in Malaysia. A quick glance at the members' guide shows that all the Dutch multinationals have a presence here. </p><p> So do many SMEs and start-ups.</p><p>I spoke to a number of you this morning. You all have your own interesting stories of continued hard work in a faraway market. Sometimes this brings quick profits. In other cases you have to take a longer view and wait before harvesting the fruits of your labours.</p><p>Last year Dutch business federations and the Federation of Dutch Exporters awarded their coveted Fenedex Prize to the Dutch Embassy here in Kuala Lumpur. Ambassador Molenaar told me that their work in close cooperation with the MDBC and individual businesses was most likely the main reason why they received the award.</p><p>As Malaysia and the surrounding ASEAN countries continue on an economic fast track and become more integrated, new opportunities and challenges will arise. I hope you will keep the famous Dutch innovative business spirit alive and forge the strongest business ties possible. </p><p>This afternoon I look forward to learning more about your experiences.</p>",2
105,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for being here today with Prime Minister Najib Razak and me. </p><p>The reason for my visit to Malaysia is the terrible fate of flight MH17. This was a tragedy that should never have occurred. 298 passengers and crew members lost their lives. Among them were more than 40 Malaysian victims. </p><p>Our thoughts are with the victims, their loved ones, relatives and friends. I realise that for Malaysia, this tragedy is only one of two disasters. You have lost two aircraft this year with all the crew and passengers. The shock and loss have hurt your country deeply. In my country we feel your pain. </p><p>In the aftermath of the MH17, we in the Netherlands have been overwhelmed by the tremendous support we have received from you and so many other Malaysians. Malaysians who continue to be involved in one way or another. </p><p>I would like to thank you most sincerely, on behalf of the Dutch government and on behalf of your Dutch counterparts, for everything you have done. Your efforts and perseverance have been invaluable in helping us to retrieve and identify the victims’ remains and belongings. And also in our efforts to identify and bring to justice the perpetrators of this terrible crime. Thanks to your tireless work, we have succeeded in identifying and repatriating many victims and their belongings. </p><p>Some of you are involved in investigating the cause of the downing of flight MH17 – a vital part of our efforts to obtain justice for the victims and their families. Many of you have worked under very difficult conditions at or near the crash site. </p><p>This tragedy has struck our countries deeply. It has also brought us closer than ever before. We are united in grief. </p><p> </p><p>Our two countries, together with Australia, will remain committed to completing the daunting task of identifying and bringing home all the victims and their possessions, of establishing the cause of the tragedy, and of bringing those responsible to justice. We will not rest until this work is done.Last week conditions allowed a small team to visit the crash site. They found remains of victims, which will be transferred to the Netherlands following the usual ceremonial protocol. We will continue to take every opportunity to go to the site. </p><p>Next Monday we will have a National Day of Remembrance in the Netherlands. We will commemorate all the victims whose lives ended so abruptly. We will also pay tribute to all those who have contributed to the repatriation mission and the investigations. </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me once again express my deep appreciation for your hard work in the aftermath of the MH17 tragedy. I know that we will carry on with this important work in the same spirit of close friendship.</p>",0
106,"<p> </p><p>Mr President, </p><p> Mr Secretary-General, </p><p> Excellencies, </p><p> fellow delegates, </p><p> ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>On 17 July, in a summer already marked by alarming reports from Syria, Iraq and Gaza, our country was confronted with stark international reality. The 298 passengers of flight MH17 would be alive today if not for the Crimea conflict and the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine. 196 of the victims were Dutch nationals. This tragedy has had an enormous impact on our country. So many innocent men, women and children. Entire families ripped from neighbourhoods, empty desks in offices and schools, teammates gone forever. Everyone in the Netherlands knew someone in that plane, directly or indirectly, and we will feel the pain for years to come. Some of the victims still haven't been identified, and this must be done as soon as possible. Nothing is more important to their loved ones, wherever in the world they may be.</p><p> </p><p>This summer we were reminded again of how closely interwoven events at home and abroad can be. And how important a stable world order is to our national interests. We saw again that when it comes to addressing the major problems facing the global community, there is simply no alternative to working together and taking a multilateral approach. This is the firm conviction of the Dutch government. We are grateful for the wide support for Security Council resolution 2166. All remains and personal belongings need to be repatriated. The cause of the MH17 disaster must be brought to light and those responsible must be brought to justice. Unhindered access to the crash site is therefore essential. The Dutch government is fully committed to achieving these goals, working with all the countries and organisations involved.</p><p> </p><p>The Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands contains a unique article that says: 'The Government shall promote the development of the international legal order'. This self-imposed responsibility comes from a long tradition of freedom, respect for the rule of law and our country's international orientation. In March 2014 we put this principle into practice once again when we hosted the Nuclear Security Summit, a conference on an important topic that must remain high on the international agenda. The events of this summer have made us even more resolute about promoting the international legal order. And about working to this end with everyone in this General Assembly, in the knowledge that peace, justice and development are closely interconnected.</p><p> </p><p>2015 is an important year for the global development agenda. We will be reviewing the Millennium Development Goals and raising the bar once again. In July the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals laid a solid foundation for the future that reflects the Netherlands' priorities. The most important goal is to eradicate extreme poverty within a generation in a way that doesn't harm economic growth, social equality or the environment. We must link short-term goals with long-term goals.</p><p> </p><p>And despite the progress made, we know that fragile states, where the rule of law barely exists, had no chance of achieving the Millennium Goals. In 2013 there were more displaced people in conflict regions than ever before. For these reasons the Netherlands applauds the Open Working Group's intention to include peace and the rule of law in the new framework. We welcome the initiative by the SG to establish the UN mission for ebola emergency response. The Netherlands will substantially increase its humanitarian aid. Part of that effort is a new contribution of 18 mln euros devoted to fighting ebola.</p><p> </p><p>In the same vein, the Netherlands will continue to support and participate in UN peacekeeping missions. We currently have military personnel and relief workers serving in Mali, South Sudan and elsewhere. The upcoming review of peacekeeping missions is an opportunity to improve this instrument and make it more effective. The Netherlands believes that major progress can be made on this front by further integrating the three Ds: defence, development and diplomacy. Our commitment to fulfilling Security Council resolution 1325 remains firm too. Because women's leadership is essential to achieving peace and security. The important role that women play as change agents in politics, economic development and society cannot be emphasised enough. As host country to many international legal institutions, including the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court, the Netherlands feels a special responsibility with respect to international law. When innocent people fall victim to impunity, human rights violations and the violence of war, the international community cannot and should not just stand by and watch. Perpetrators must be brought to justice, however complex and time-consuming the process may be.</p><p> </p><p>We owe this not only to the passengers of flight MH17, but also to the victims of violence in Syria and Iraq. The horrifying images of mass executions and beheadings in the region are burned into our memories. They impress upon us how important it is for the Security Council and international legal institutions to be able to act boldly and decisively.</p><p> </p><p>The Kingdom of the Netherlands, your partner for peace, justice and development, is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council in 2017 and 2018. We want to help modernise and strengthen this important UN body. Renewal is needed to ensure its effectiveness and legitimacy. The Security Council must be able to act in a crisis. When mass atrocities are being committed somewhere in the world, veto power should be exercised with greater restraint. We salute the French initiative in this regard. We also believe that the Security Council's authority and resolve would be enhanced if the UN member states were more broadly represented. This is especially true of the African states, which in our opinion are underrepresented.</p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p> Dag Hammarskjöld once said in this assembly that the principles of the Charter of the United Nations '[…] are, by far, greater than the Organization in which they are embodied, and the aims which they are to safeguard are holier than the policies of any single nation or people.'</p><p> </p><p>The Netherlands shares this conviction and remains steadfast in its commitment to promoting the international legal order, as our Constitution demands. </p><p> Thank you.</p>",2
107,"<p>Madam President,</p><p>The direct threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters concerns us all. Both our international and our national security are at risk. As a country of origin for such fighters, the Netherlands raised its terrorist threat level to the second highest level eighteen months ago.</p><p>But most alarming of all is the situation in the conflict zones themselves. Innocent civilians are victims of merciless violence. The threat is serious, and it calls for a serious response. This is a duty that rests on us, the international community. That is also the reason why today the Dutch government decided to increase its support to the international effort to stop ISIS by providing military means. We will provide F16's and military training and advice. In total we provide 380 men and women. </p><p>Last year, in the framework of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) the Netherlands and Morocco launched a joint initiative to formulate good practices in tackling the problem of foreign terrorist fighters. Yesterday, at the GCTF ministerial meeting, we presented the outcome: a comprehensive set of guidelines focused on every aspect of the foreign fighter threat. These recommendations cover not only counterterrorism responses, but also preventive efforts.</p><p>As co-leader of the Forum’s working group on foreign terrorist fighters, the Netherlands will promote the adoption of these good practices. We are open to working actively with all UN member states and UN partners on this issue.</p><p>The UN sanctions regime is essential to addressing the problem of foreign terrorist fighters. Sanctions are an important instrument for depriving terrorist organisations and fighters of their sources of finance. And sanctions could be tightened further. These sanctions, however, must be implemented and monitored properly. Or they won’t be effective in practice. We should, I believe, examine at UN level whether the monitoring and technical assistance provided to member states can be enhanced.</p><p>Madam President,</p><p>It is vital that the international community act jointly on this issue. The resolution adopted today and cosponsored by the Netherlands, sends a strong signal that we should stand shoulder to shoulder to confront the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters. </p><p>Madam President, thank you.</p>",0
108,"<p>Secretary-General, esteemed colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>At some point you may have landed at Amsterdam Airport without realising that the runway was over four metres below sea level.</p><p>This is a good example of our geography as a low-lying delta region. Without dams and dikes, more than half our country would be under water all or part of the time. So you can imagine that climate change and its effects are a major concern in my country, and we are determined to take action.</p><p>In brief, my message to you today is: if we act now and if we act together, we can mitigate climate change and we can adapt to the physical and environmental challenges we face. Both sides of this equation are important. And in both cases, cooperation is crucial.</p><p>First and foremost, I mean international cooperation between countries and regions, and our shared responsibility to confront climate change. That's why we're here. That's why we aim to forge an ambitious climate agreement next year in Paris. All countries must contribute in line with their ability.</p><p>This principle will be set down in the new climate agreement, and we have  to make it happen. For example, with the help of the new Green Climate Fund, which the Netherlands is keen to contribute to. But in order to achieve our international ambitions, it is also vital for government authorities, businesses and civil society organisations to work together at national level.</p><p>Last year, the Netherlands reached a deal with 40 different partners, from Shell to Greenpeace. Our common goal is energy innovation, and in this way we will ensure that the Netherlands meets - and even exceeds - its climate goals for 2020. My country will cancel an extra 14 million tons of CO2 credits.</p><p>Many other countries in the EU have a similar story to tell. The target is a 20 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions in Europe between 1990 and 2020. The Netherlands believe that the European target for 2030 should be at least twice that, and for 2050, 80 to 95%. This is very ambitious, but experience teaches that we can accomplish a lot by forming broad coalitions.</p><p>We need to keep using incentives to encourage climate innovation. For example, by putting a price tag on CO2 emissions, like the European Emissions Trading Scheme. Our philosophy is simple: making sustainability a business case is the best guarantee for a successful climate policy. Green growth pays. There is a future to be won, and money to be made.</p><p>The focus on cooperation is also visible in the way we in the Netherlands deal with the effects of climate change. In our case, this means preparing for a rising sea level and higher peak discharges in the major rivers that flow through our country. If Amsterdam Airport is five metres below sea level in a hundred years, planes will still have to be able to land safely. That's our mission.</p><p>This battle against water is not new for us, of course. But the need to act is clearer and more compelling than ever.</p><p>With this in mind, we've launched a special delta programme in which central government works with municipalities and the water sector. The programme is institution-based and well-funded, and it runs all the way to the next century. For the first time in our long history of water management, we are not trying to deal with the previous disaster, but looking to the future, to prevent a new one.</p><p>Our special relationship with water and all the specific know-how we've built up over the years brings with it a special responsibility to share this knowledge, exchange expertise and offer assistance. The Dutch government and business community are more than willing to do so, especially in developing countries, where large numbers of people and a lot of economic activity are concentrated in low-lying deltas. But every country is vulnerable to some degree. In this city, which was hit so hard by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, it is fitting to mention the Resilient Cities Initiative, which is sharing state-of-the-art knowledge on water safety with 2,000 cities worldwide. We in the Netherlands are also doing our part in this regard. And we will continue to do so.</p><p>So, ladies and gentleman, let's act. Let's act now and let's act together. </p><p>Thank you.</p>",1
109,"<p> </p><p>Your Majesty, </p><p> Your Excellencies, </p><p> ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>I recently read in the paper about a new study at the University of Wageningen. Researchers there are analysing the DNA of generations of Dutch dairy cows. This genetic information tells them whether a cow is likely to produce a lot of milk and whether it will remain healthy. That way, productive cows can be bred without the need for antibiotics. Smart research like this helps feed more mouths and improves animal welfare. And that’s what sustainable development is all about in 2014. It’s not just a matter for politicians. It’s companies and universities, not government, that are creating solutions for today’s problems and for the future.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, government remains a key enabler.  We need to work together. We need to build broad-based coalitions between government, businesses and consumers. Only then can we solve the major problems of the 21st century, like hunger, poverty and climate change. 2015 is an important year for the global development agenda. We’ll be reviewing the Millennium Development Goals and raising the bar once again. In July the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals laid a solid foundation for the future that reflects the Netherlands’ priorities. We share the hope for a better future and the ambition to make it happen.</p><p> </p><p>At tomorrow’s climate summit, government, businesses and civil society will once again join forces to create an ambitious climate agreement. In the Netherlands we’re working to do the same on a smaller scale. We’re pooling knowledge, expertise and resources to reach major goals that no single party could achieve alone. We’re joining hands with municipalities, companies, environmental organisations and other parties to create sustainable energy supplies. But you don’t always need the government. Look at the research being done in Wageningen. Or at the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition, set up in 2012 by eight leading multinationals, including, Heineken, KLM, Shell and my former employer Unilever. Together they’re developing and sharing sustainable business models.</p><p> </p><p>It won’t surprise you that Paul Polman, an esteemed member of the High Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, is one of the coalition’s leaders. It shows the broad support that sustainability now enjoys among the business community. More and more companies are opting for sustainability and corporate social responsibility, in many cases a step ahead of the government. Business is leading the way, and not only from noble motives.</p><p> </p><p>To quote our host Paul Polman in his speech to the UN: ‘it is not just about philanthropy or altruism. It makes business sense.’ Sustainability is becoming mainstream. Consumers demand it. They want products made in a responsible way.</p><p> </p><p>And they stand up to companies who don’t meet high standards. Sustainable innovations create income and jobs. So there’s a future to be won and money to be made. In short, the Sustainable Development Goals can’t be achieved without the private sector. Without the University of Wageningen’s smart solutions. Without Unilever’s Sustainable Living Plan.</p><p> </p><p>And without other companies and knowledge centres stepping in. But government plays a role too, bringing companies and research institutions together and promoting sustainable innovation. It’s all in the theme of this dinner: we’re working on a ‘transformative change for a brighter future.’</p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
110,"<p>Deputy Prime Minister Hai, Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Welcome to this networking lunch. </p><p>The clue is in the name. We’re here to network. To encourage new, successful business ventures by giving entrepreneurs a chance to meet and explore opportunities together. And one thing’s certain: these opportunities exist. Because the economic ties between Vietnam and the Netherlands are booming.</p><p>Of all the EU member states, the Netherlands is the biggest investor in Vietnam and its third-biggest trading partner. A hundred and twenty Dutch firms already operate in your country and many others are ready to follow their example. In the last decade, trade between the Netherlands and Vietnam has increased nearly tenfold, to 3.6 billion dollars.</p><p>In the past few days I’ve seen Vietnam’s energy with my own eyes. In this vibrant country, the spirit of enterprise is everywhere. Even during the recent global crisis, Vietnam’s growth has been solid. And international economic integration has been a cornerstone of national policy for years now.</p><p>Today, Vietnam is a dynamic emerging market with major potential. As you know, I’ve come to Vietnam with a large business delegation of well-known Dutch companies that are keen to work with Vietnam. And to judge by our warm reception, the feeling is mutual.</p><p>The businesspeople here today represent the best my country has to offer in the fields of water and maritime affairs, agri-food, horticulture, energy and logistics. Some of them have been doing business in Vietnam for years now and they’re enthusiastic about the experience. But they also tell us about the challenges companies face.</p><p>And of course, it can be hard to stay committed to international integration, and not to create trade barriers at times of economic or political challenges. But I’m confident that if we consolidate our excellent bilateral ties we can overcome these challenges.</p><p>Today we’re here to expand existing networks and build new ones. Despite the economic challenges in recent years, our trade and investment volumes are still growing. That shows how well we work together. We are strategic partners in many fields. Rest assured that the Dutch government will continue to support this partnership wherever we can. Or, if you’ll allow me a World Cup metaphor: we’ll prepare the pitch so that you can score the goals.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",4
111,"<p>Prime Minister Dung, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>What could be more logical than the water partnership between Vietnam and the Netherlands? Especially in the Mekong Delta, a region that has a lot in common with my country. They are both densely-populated, low-lying delta regions of a similar size and population. </p><p>And we face similar challenges as a result of climate change: rising sea levels, changing river water regimes and salt intrusion. That’s why, four years ago, we decided to work together closely in the Mekong Delta Plan. Because when experts from different fields, different cultures and different countries come together, they can learn from each other. </p><p>At the end of 2013 a long-term vision was presented for the Mekong Delta. All international partners were present, including Melanie Schultz van Haegen, the Dutch minister responsible for water management.</p><p>Now it’s time to turn words into deeds. And I’d like to underline the joint call for a strong framework for development, as set out in the partner statement accompanying that vision. To succeed, ambitious, long-term projects like the Mekong Delta Plan need a clear strategy. And they also need to be properly embedded from an institutional and organisational point of view.</p><p>Nobody knows that better than the Dutch. For over a thousand years my country has battled with water. We built dikes to keep our feet dry. We created land from water. We built towns in marshy regions.</p><p>And now, because of climate change, we face new and even bigger challenges. We need to keep doing what we’re good at. But we also need to find new ways of safeguarding our future. And that requires new and different ways of doing things. In my country we’ve drawn up a special law, the Delta Act, which lays down all the necessary arrangements and long-term financing. That’s essential.</p><p>Of course, we gladly share our knowledge and expertise with other delta regions. Not only as an export product, but also because we see it as a duty. And because we know that two heads are better than one.</p><p>For we, in turn, can learn from the people of the Mekong Delta. For centuries they’ve been adapting their way of life to the water, and that’s something that we in the Netherlands are only just learning to do. So we need to help each other, and make each other stronger. The Mekong Delta Plan will help tackle one of the biggest challenges facing the world – how to cope with the impact of climate change.</p><p>The other great challenge, of course, is how to feed nine billion mouths by 2050. Just like the Netherlands, the Mekong Delta is a very fertile region with immense agricultural potential.</p><p>How can this potential best be exploited? How does flood protection relate to the availability of sufficient water of satisfactory quality? And how do we balance the interests of humankind with environmental interests? The Mekong Delta Plan will help address all these questions in a sustainable and integrated way.</p><p>Yesterday Vietnam and the Netherlands signed a strategic partnership arrangement on sustainable agriculture and food security, because in this field, too, we have a lot to offer each other. With a surface area similar to the Mekong Delta, the Netherlands accounts for 7.5 per cent of global food exports, making us the second-largest exporter in the world. </p><p>I hope the Mekong Delta will be equally successful. Vietnam is already a major exporter of agricultural products. And the shift from quantity to quality – evident in recent policy changes – will certainly bring more success in the future. In short, the Mekong Delta Plan promises a great deal, and it’s gratifying that it’s widely supported by the international community. Because although the plan is based on Vietnamese ownership with Dutch support, its implementation calls for a joint effort.</p><p>Together we can put theory into practice, so that the Mekong Delta can develop in a sustainable way. In true partnership, we can make the most of its immense potential.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",0
112,"<p>Prime Minister, </p><p> Your Excellencies, </p><p> ladies and gentlemen, </p><p>One of the first Dutchmen to set foot in Vietnam - back in 1601 - was the merchant</p><p> Jeronimus Wonderaer. </p><p> </p><p>In his letters home he spoke highly of the hospitality he received in your beautiful country. </p><p> Whatever may have changed since then, that has not, and I would like to thank you - on behalf of the entire Dutch delegation - for the very warm reception you have given us. </p><p>Prime Minister Dung, after your visits to our country, I'm delighted to have the opportunity to visit yours. </p><p> I follow in the footsteps of many of my compatriots, including our current King and Queen, who paid a very successful visit to Vietnam in 2011. </p><p> These bilateral contacts underline the growing importance of the ties between our two countries.</p><p>Last year we celebrated forty years of diplomatic relations and hundreds of thousands of people visited Holland Village in Ho Chi Minh City. </p><p> And more and more Vietnamese and Dutch politicians, business people and experts are getting connected. </p><p> That's no coincidence. </p><p> Of all the EU member states, the Netherlands is the biggest investor in Vietnam and its third-biggest trade partner. </p><p> A hundred and twenty Dutch firms already operate in your country and many others are ready to follow their example. </p><p> In the last decade, trade between the Netherlands and Vietnam has increased nearly tenfold, to 3.6 billion dollars.</p><p>These facts and figures say a lot about the amazing speed of your country's development. </p><p> It fills us with admiration. </p><p> Vietnam's progress has been truly remarkable. </p><p> Your unique location, your young, hard-working population and your open and international outlook make Vietnam what it is today: a vibrant economy with great potential, and an attractive partner for a country like ours.</p><p>I strongly believe that Vietnam and the Netherlands are natural allies. </p><p> Both our countries are world players in the export of agricultural products. </p><p> We are both coastal states with strategic locations, and we excel in maritime affairs and logistics. </p><p> And as delta countries, we both face the challenges of climate change, especially in the fields of water management and energy. </p><p> So I've come to Vietnam with representatives of major Dutch companies that are active in these four sectors of mutual interest: water and maritime affairs, agriculture and energy. </p><p> We're all convinced that we can learn a lot from each other and that doing business will benefit both our countries.</p><p>Back in 2010 we signed a strategic partnership arrangement on water management and climate change adaptation. </p><p> We're now putting that partnership into practice with the Mekong Delta Plan, which brings together Vietnamese and Dutch expertise in the field of water. </p><p> The plan combines flood protection with great opportunities for the agricultural sector. </p><p> I look forward to our talks tomorrow with the international donors involved. </p><p>Today we agreed a second strategic partnership on sustainable agriculture and food security. </p><p> It's the next step in our framework for long-term bilateral cooperation. </p><p> We believe that sustainability is key to future economic success. </p><p> So the Dutch businesses here today are all committed to complying with international standards. </p><p> In recent years your country has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty. </p><p> This paves the way for new goals to promote the ongoing international integration of the Vietnamese economy. </p><p> And let me assure you that the Netherlands will remain committed to Vietnam's sustainable development.</p><p>I'm confident Vietnam will continue to open up through economic and political reforms. </p><p> Because that's essential to remain competitive. </p><p> We admire your efforts to reform the state-owned sector, promote public-private partnerships and fight red tape and corruption. </p><p> But it's a hard job and major challenges remain. </p><p> The Netherlands stands ready to support you wherever we can. </p><p> The EU-Vietnam Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Vietnam will be very important in this respect. </p><p> Not only will they boost trade and investment, to our mutual benefit. </p><p> They will also help generate support for your reforms. </p><p> The deadline for signing the Free Trade Agreement is ambitious, but I understand that both sides are keen to finalise it this year.</p><p>Prime Minister Dung, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, Vietnam will remain a top priority country, both for the Dutch government and the Dutch business community. </p><p> Together we will move forward, building on firm foundations of bilateral cooperation and friendship.</p><p>So now let me propose a toast. </p><p> To the friendship between the Vietnamese and Dutch peoples. </p><p> To successful partnerships between our businesses. </p><p> And to the future of your beautiful country, whose fantastic hospitality I have now experienced for myself.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",4
113,"<p> </p><p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>Welcome to the Netherlands, and welcome to The Hague, international city of peace and justice.</p><p> </p><p>As you may know, the Peace Palace, which celebrated its centenary a few months ago, is only a short walk from this convention centre. Over the past hundred years the Peace Palace has become the symbol of efforts to create a stable world order by means of international cooperation. And that is exactly what is driving our efforts to make this third Nuclear Security Summit a success. All our discussions today and tomorrow will focus on one question: how to prevent nuclear terrorism?Or to be more precise: how can we make sure that nuclear materials won't end up in the hands of terrorists and that nuclear material is used more efficiently and stored more securely.</p><p> </p><p>President Obama, you are personally responsible for getting this issue on the international agenda. The first Nuclear Security Summit in 2010, and the Washington Work Plan that it produced, still guide our efforts today. You laid the foundations, and so the world is in your debt.</p><p> </p><p>President Park, two years ago your country hosted the second NSS, where we noted the progress we had made and raised our ambitions. And with success, because looking back on the past two years, we can see that real progress has been made. Not only have diplomatic efforts moved forward and documents been adopted, but there have also been quantifiable results. For example, since the process began the number of countries with more than a kilogram of usable highly enriched uranium has fallen substantially. This shows that we set off in the right direction four years ago in Washington, and that the summit in Seoul was also productive.</p><p> </p><p>But we cannot rest on our laurels. We have to raise our ambitions again. We have to aim even higher here in The Hague. Because even as we speak, there are still almost 2,000 tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material in circulation worldwide. And its security has to be our constant concern.</p><p> </p><p>We know how little material is needed to make a crude nuclear bomb. We know that the technologies  required to make such a bomb are spreading. And we know - especially since 9/11 - that unscrupulous terrorists will not hesitate to use any weapon they can get their hands on. So the need to take steps to prevent nuclear terrorism is growing more urgent, not less.</p><p> </p><p>The task we took on four years ago is not an easy one. But perhaps working for a safe, stable world is never easy. As Dag Hammarskjöld once said, 'The pursuit of peace and progress, with its trials and its errors, its successes and its setbacks, can never be relaxed and never abandoned.' And he was right. There is no magic formula we can use to free the world once and for all from the menace of nuclear terrorism. </p><p> And sitting back and doing nothing is not an option. But we are making progress, step by step.</p><p> </p><p>There are three main goals we need to stay focused on at this summit and afterwards.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>A great deal of advance work has been done in the run-up to this Nuclear Security Summit. Today and tomorrow we will hone our common objectives and set our course for the years ahead. The long-running debate on improving the security of nuclear material has been like running a marathon. Every now and then we make a dash forwards. This time we are making a dash in The Hague. We will make another in 2016 at the next summit in the US - on our way to embed nuclear security firmly in national, regional and global institutions and procedures.</p><p> </p><p>Your presence here today underscores once more your countries' political commitment to this goal. This should give us confidence that we will succeed. The task we took on in 2010 demands resolve, and perhaps more patience than we would like. But in the words of Nelson Mandela, whose statue stands outside, close by: 'It always seems impossible until it's done.' Let us press on in that conviction - today, tomorrow and in the days that follow - towards our goal of a safer world.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you so much.</p>",0
114,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Netherlands, welcome to Amsterdam, and welcome to this special location. </p><p> </p><p>We're standing here on historic ground - surrounded by the finest paintings that Holland has produced and only a stone's throw from the house of John Adams, the first American ambassador to the Netherlands and second president of the United States. It's a location that symbolises the enduring partnership between the US and the Netherlands. Our shared history and heritage go back a long way. </p><p>As a historian, it was a very special moment for me when, earlier today, I was able to show President Obama two original documents from our National Archives that played an important role in the age-old friendship between our two countries. The first was our own 'Declaration of Independence', the Plakkaat van Verlatinghe of 1581, which inspired Thomas Jefferson and his peers. The second was the American-Dutch Treaty of Amity and Trust of 1782 - another remarkable document from an age when peace between countries was usually a hard-fought affair. </p><p>And today, friendship is still at the heart of the relationship between the United States and the Netherlands, along with trade, shared values and joint responsibilities. Since that first treaty we have worked together in the growing awareness that economic prosperity, a safe and stable world and international cooperation go hand in hand. </p><p>With this in mind, the President and I talked about a wide range of subjects. Starting with joint climate initiatives and the new steps we will take today in that regard. The Netherlands is joining with the United States and a group of other countries in a bid to stop international public funding of new coal-fired power plants, for example by multilateral development banks. We want to achieve an international level playing field, to ensure that private and public parties invest in green growth wherever possible. </p><p>We also discussed the important topic of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement between the EU and the US. Once concluded, this agreement will create more economic growth and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. Importantly, it will set new standards that will benefit global trade and third countries as well. This partnership will bolster our excellent bilateral economic ties even further. During our conversation I stressed how much we value this partnership. The Netherlands is the world's third largest investor in the United States, and we are home to some 1800 American businesses. </p><p>And of course we also spoke about the major international security issues in Syria, Iran and the Ukraine. Concerning the latter, we both regard Russia's attempts to annex the Crimea as a flagrant breach of international law, and we condemn its actions in the strongest possible terms. The presence of so many world leaders in the Netherlands this week presents an important opportunity for the international community to discuss this subject as well as other pressing issues that affect our common interests. </p><p>Finally, we looked ahead to the Nuclear Security Summit today and tomorrow. President Obama deserves all the credit for getting this topic high on the agenda. In 2010, Washington hosted the first summit on this theme. In 2012, it was Seoul's turn. And now the Netherlands is proud to host a summit, today and tomorrow in The Hague, that will bring us closer to the goal of securing potentially dangerous nuclear material. Your presence, Barack, underlines the importance of the summit. And this event, too, demonstrates the strength of the bilateral ties between our countries, and of our joint commitment to peace, security and democracy. I am delighted to be able to reaffirm that publicly, here at this splendid location. </p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
115,"<p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>For the next few days, the Nuclear Security Summit will have this country in its grip, literally and figuratively. The same goes for events linked to the NSS, like the Nuclear Industry Summit that has brought you to Amsterdam. In logistical terms alone, we have never known an operation like this in the Netherlands.But we are glad to host these events, because the subject is so important.</p><p> </p><p>So I’m delighted to welcome you to the Netherlands. And I know I can also speak for my colleague Henk Kamp who is also here this evening and who will address your conference tomorrow. Tomorrow and the day after in The Hague, over 50 world leaders will once more take major steps to prevent nuclear terrorism.</p><p> </p><p>Since the first summit in Washington in 2010, this process has achieved clear results. Think for example of the declining use of highly enriched uranium for reactor fuel and medical isotope production.</p><p> </p><p>This shows that four years ago we set out in the right direction and that we are making good progress. The key question we will discuss in the next few days is: how can we make sure that nuclear material is safely handled, traded and stored and doesn’t end up in the wrong hands? From the start of the process we’ve been aware of the importance of the companies and research centres that work with such material.</p><p> </p><p>The Netherlands is a strong advocate of government-to-industry dialogue. I know you’re all committed to excellence and I highly appreciate your efforts. You, the civil nuclear sector, are our first line of defence, so security has to be a top priority in everything you do. But your security measures also have to give you enough scope to do your highly specialised work properly and efficiently. After all, we cannot forget how useful, even essential nuclear technology is in many ways.</p><p> </p><p>For energy, for example. Or in medicine. We in the Netherlands know this better than anyone. Thirty per cent of all the isotopes used worldwide to treat cancer and detect heart disease come from the Dutch reactor in Petten.And Urenco in the Netherlands is one of the world’s leading producers of enriched uranium.</p><p> </p><p>For these reasons too, the Nuclear Industry Summit is important for our country. This is the third time the NIS is being held alongside the NSS. I would like to thank Huub Rakhorst of Urenco for all the time and energy his company has put into the preparations. Over the next two days you will once more be examining every facet of securing nuclear material. That includes how production is organised. But equally important is striking and maintaining the right balance between your role as nuclear licence holders and government’s role as policymaker and regulator.</p><p> </p><p>I’m optimistic about the outcome of this process, because we’ve managed in the preparations to give fostering dialogue a prominent place on the NSS agenda – an even higher place than in Washington and Seoul. This will be reflected in the final communiqué, and that’s good news. It demonstrates how aware all the parties are of their shared responsibility for nuclear security. So I was glad as NSS chair to invite your chair to present the conclusions of this third NIS in The Hague on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>I hope you will find time in your busy schedule in the next few days to see something of the Netherlands. I can promise you that this splendid location in our capital city and this delicious dinner are only a foretaste of the fine and beautiful things that our country has to offer our visitors from abroad.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you for coming to the Netherlands, for your commitment to the NIS, and for your attention.</p><p> </p><p>I would like to propose a toast: to a successful Nuclear Industry Summit!</p>",0
116,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Selamat malam!</p><p>Welcome to the Borobudur Hotel and thank you for inviting me to say a few words before dinner. It’s good to see so many business leaders gathered here tonight. That says something about our countries’ mutual ambitions and the economic potential we see in each other. </p><p>Yesterday President Yudhoyono and I issued our Joint Declaration on a Comprehensive Partnership. This Declaration is what our visit is all about. And in fact, our detailed discussions today show that we’re already putting it into practice. In this document, the president and I reaffirm how vital and valuable we believe our relationship is. We state clearly that Indonesia and the Netherlands want to move forward together. That we have a lot to offer each other in economic, political and cultural terms. And that we see great opportunities ahead. In short: this document is all about a forward-looking relationship in which we can join forces and reap mutual benefits.</p><p>The Netherlands is already Indonesia’s second-biggest trading partner within the European Union. And thanks to the port of Rotterdam and Schiphol Airport, we are also Indonesia’s gateway to the rest of Europe. What’s more, for many years now the Netherlands has been the largest European investor in Indonesia. But both Dutch and Indonesian businesses rightly see many more opportunities for cooperation. Last year, trade between our countries rose by no less than 18 per cent, defying the current global trend. That speaks for itself.</p><p>It also explains why this is the biggest Dutch trade mission to Indonesia ever. I am joined by more than a hundred companies. Some have been doing business here for decades, and others want to get a foothold. But they all see opportunities and want to join forces. They represent business sectors in which the Dutch have always excelled. Sectors where our countries already work together closely, and where the future opportunities are biggest.</p><p>We also have a lot to offer each other in the international arena. The Netherlands can help steer Indonesia through the world of EU legislation and rules. In fact, we’re already doing so, for example with a training programme to help Indonesia comply with the EU’s air cargo safety regulations. Indonesia likewise can help the Netherlands access the ASEAN market.</p><p>Indonesia has the potential to become the world’s seventh-biggest economy by 2030. That says something about the impressive way the country has developed in recent years. In the Netherlands we’ve been watching this progress with great admiration. The global financial crisis seems to have passed Indonesia by. Year after year, it achieves growth figures of around six per cent. In Europe, the construction industry is suffering, but here skyscrapers are shooting up all the time.</p><p>Car manufacturers and electronics firms are doing better than ever, thanks to the rising middle class. We have deep respect for these achievements.</p><p>All this explains why Dutch businesses are so interested in Indonesia. We hope that by offering Dutch expertise in the sectors we excel in, we can contribute to Indonesia’s impressive economic development. There are good foundations for this type of cooperation. For decades both countries have worked together closely in the area of flood protection. We are applying Dutch know-how in efforts to protect Jakarta from flooding. In the process we are also learning about the type of flood risks the Netherlands may face in the future.</p><p>Our maritime industry, which includes companies like IHC Merwede, also has a lot to offer. The same goes for the Dutch aviation industry, which is also represented in our trade mission, and is involved in several big projects at Indonesian airports.</p><p>Take the Dutch company VanDerLande, which developed the baggage-handling system for Indonesia’s newest international airport at Medan, in North Sumatra.</p><p>Our mission also includes Dutch companies and research organisations in the area of agri-food, life sciences and health care. They see plenty of scope for working with Indonesian partners on the many challenges Indonesia faces in developing its healthcare sector. The Dutch firm BMA, for example, has teamed up with partners here to develop a system for maternal pre-natal registration in Indonesia, which will help improve health care for pregnant women and newborn babies.</p><p>During our visit there will be plenty of opportunity to make new contacts. Various participants will be concluding concrete agreements with their Indonesian counterparts at a signing ceremony later this evening. These agreements are based on cooperation geared to innovation. That’s something we certainly have in common. They involve large companies like Frisian Flag and East-West Seed, as well as the joint venture between Dutch firm Resin and its Indonesian partner Polymindo.</p><p>I hope that the days ahead will produce many more initiatives like these. I also hope that the Netherlands and Indonesia will continue to join forces as they have in the past, creating many fine plans for the future. Our countries share a special bond. A bond to cherish and to build on. That’s why we are here.</p><p>Terima Kasih. Thank you.</p>",4
117,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Selamat datang.</p><p>Welcome to the beautiful tropical gardens of the Borobudur Hotel.</p><p>Let me begin by thanking our hosts, the Indonesian and Dutch Chambers of Commerce and employers’ associations.</p><p>I’m delighted that so many people from the Indonesian and Dutch business communities could be here.</p><p>That bodes well for this economic mission.</p><p>And for the future economic ties between our two countries.</p><p>Because those economic ties are the main focus of this visit.</p><p>Indonesia and the Netherlands share a long and eventful history.</p><p>A history that has seen several ups and downs.</p><p>But our past is something we share, and something that helps us face the future together.</p><p>If I say anemer, bensin or kantor pos, both Dutch and Indonesian people will understand what I mean.</p><p>But it is important not to get stuck in the past.</p><p>The world is changing, and Indonesia is no exception.</p><p>It has become a major global player, politically and economically.</p><p>Its economy is growing by around six per cent a year, and it is a prominent member of the UN, the G20 and above all ASEAN.</p><p>We in the Netherlands admire these achievements.</p><p>And Dutch companies are showing more and more interest in Indonesia.</p><p>So it’s only logical that this is the biggest Dutch economic mission to Indonesia ever.</p><p>With representatives of over a hundred companies from sectors where the Netherlands has always excelled.</p><p>Sectors where we already work closely together and which offer the best opportunities for the future.</p><p>Horticulture, agri-food, life sciences and health, logistics and water.</p><p>Representatives of these sectors are here today.</p><p>You’ve already met one another and exchanged ideas over the past two days. </p><p>No doubt all sorts of plans are taking shape.</p><p>May the discussions continue in the days ahead – and don’t forget to swap business cards!</p><p>For this trip offers many opportunities.</p><p>We can share knowledge and support each other.</p><p>This is already happening on a large scale.</p><p>For example, I have seen how Dutch companies like Van Oord and Royal HaskoningDHV are working with Indonesian companies to develop the port of Jakarta.</p><p>Very impressive – there’s no other way to describe it.</p><p>Or take the Dutch company RESIN and its Indonesian partner Polymindo: they have developed a completely new, fire-retardant plastic based on non-toxic technology.</p><p>And they are so pleased with the new material that they are now jointly introducing it on the Indonesian market.</p><p>Then there is East-West Seed, which supports innovation in the horticultural sector, and Frisian Flag, with its ‘dairy villages’ project, which is doing the same in the Indonesian dairy sector.</p><p>So cooperation between our two countries is blossoming, even though they are thousands of kilometres apart.</p><p>I hope that many more ideas and contacts like this will develop during this trip.</p><p>So that we can further deepen our special, long-standing relationship by making joint plans for the future.</p><p>Terima kasih, thank you.</p><p>Let us raise our glasses to the friendship between our countries, to new opportunities and to the Indonesian and Dutch business people who are seizing these opportunities.</p>",6
118,"<p>Alumni, friends of the Netherlands, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>It’s good to see you all here today. I’ve been looking forward to meeting you, and I invite you to share your ideas on the relationship between the Netherlands and Indonesia when we open up the discussion. What is going well? What is not? What can we do better in the future? What can we learn from each other? How can we keep supporting each other? I’m especially interested in your answers to these questions as you have first-hand experience of the Netherlands.</p><p>Given its role as a cultural meeting place for our two countries, the Erasmus Huis is the perfect location for today’s event. But it’s also a symbolic location.</p><p>But above all, it says everything about your strong personal connection with our country. A connection that we in the Netherlands value. Since the 1950s, around 20,000 young Indonesians have studied in the Netherlands. And right now there are about twelve hundred of them. The oldest Indonesian student association in the world, PPI Belanda, was founded in the Netherlands in 1922. And it’s still going strong, with more than two thousand members.</p><p>So you are part of a long tradition with a promising future. Because in a way, you and all the other Indonesian alumni of Dutch colleges and universities are the oil in the wheels of our two countries’ working relationship. You know our culture, our language and our customs – however odd some of them might seem!</p><p>This makes you ambassadors for a relationship that has always been important, and will only become more important in the future. And did you know that one in every ten Dutch people has a special bond with Indonesia? It is often a matter of family history, as in my case. My parents lived and worked here for a long time before I was born, and so Indonesia has become part of my personal history too. That makes this visit extra special for me.</p><p>But for many young people in the Netherlands, it is not the past that defines their relationship with Indonesia, but the future. The same applies to you and all the other young Indonesians who have gone to the Netherlands to invest in their own futures.</p><p>The number of partnerships and joint projects between our countries’ universities, knowledge institutions and companies continues to grow. This is partly because Indonesia and the Netherlands face similar challenges, for example in the area of flood protection. And in the wake of those challenges our mutual economic interests are also growing. It’s no coincidence that I am joined on this trip by the largest business delegation ever to visit Indonesia. It is made up of some 110 companies that all see opportunities in working more closely with Indonesia. And it includes global players like Unilever, FrieslandCampina and Philips. The opportunities are certainly there.</p><p>The Netherlands is already Indonesia’s main European export destination, and thanks to the port of Rotterdam, we are also your gateway to the rest of Europe. For our part, we are the biggest European investor in Indonesia, and last year trade between our countries rose by 18 per cent, defying all economic trends. That says something about the promise our relationship holds. We can still learn a lot from each other and do a lot for each other. And believe me: in the Netherlands, we admire the way Indonesia is developing. To start with, there’s the economy: Indonesia enjoys annual growth of five or six per cent – figures we can only dream of in Europe. Your country currently has the 16th-biggest economy in the world. By 2030 it could well be the seventh-biggest. That kind of rapid growth is an amazing achievement. Indonesia is writing economic history.</p><p>My respect for this achievement is all the greater in view of the many other positive developments supporting this intense economic growth. The middle class is expanding rapidly, poverty is declining and robust institutions are taking shape. This is helping to create a climate in which people develop the confidence to invest in themselves and their surroundings. And I have equal respect for the way Indonesia has shown its willingness to take responsibility for the global challenges we face.</p><p>As a member of the G20, for example, and as one of the driving forces behind ASEAN. Playing this active role is important – not only for your country’s future, but for that of other countries, too. Some issues today are simply too big for countries to tackle alone. How are we going to feed nine billion people in 2050? How should we adapt globally to the rise in sea level and the mounting flood risk in our large river deltas? What effect will higher life expectancy have on health care in the future? How can we make sure that our cities remain both accessible and pleasant places to live? These are only a few of the issues we face. You in Indonesia. We in the Netherlands. People all over the world. These big issues will be at the heart of the contacts forged between Indonesian and Dutch companies and knowledge institutions during this visit. They are issues that call for knowledge-exchange and collaboration. Across national and regional boundaries. And that means we need people like you. People with enough curiosity to step out of their comfort zone. People with the ambition and drive to get ahead in life. People who are open to other cultures and other ways of thinking. Fortunately, it’s now easier than ever to engage with other cultures and ideas. And the contacts between us are closer than ever, too. In that respect we live in a marvellous age.</p><p>In the last century, my parents travelled from the Netherlands to Indonesia by boat. The voyage took weeks. Now, a few decades later, our countries are only a mouse click away from each other. In a short time, the internet, Skype and social media have given us new and exciting ways of working together and helping each other. And it’s paying off. Certainly here in Indonesia, with its young population and enterprising spirit. Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps you will remember this Dutch saying from your time in the Netherlands: ‘Wat je van ver haalt, is lekker.’ It means, ‘Exotic food tastes good,’ and as a big fan of Indonesian cuisine, I can only agree. But this idea goes way beyond food, of course. Knowledge acquired in the outside world enriches us. You can’t beat personal contact in international relations. And that is why it’s so important that we keep investing in programmes that allow young people to go to the Netherlands to study and get to know the country. You are living proof that this provides a triple benefit. For you and your careers. For Indonesia. And for the Netherlands, too. Because with every new Indonesian student we gain an ambassador in a country that has always been, and always will be, extremely important to us.</p><p>Dank u wel. Terima Kasih. </p>",6
119,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, </p><p> I would also like to welcome you and thank you for coming this evening. It is good to have this chance to meet. </p><p> I have just come from a dinner with President Xi Jinping. </p><p> We had a long talk about the good working partnership between our countries. </p><p> And about all the opportunities for making that partnership even stronger. Not least in the economic arena. </p><p> So what could be better than to talk straight away to the very companies and research institutions that can capitalise on these opportunities? </p><p> Very shortly, no less than five cooperation agreements will be signed here. </p><p> Together they are a fine example of what our countries have to offer each other. </p><p> They cover a range of sectors and themes: aviation, chemicals, flowers, LED lighting and the financial sector. </p><p> I think this wide range of subjects highlights the success of economic cooperation between China and the Netherlands. </p><p> And let us not underestimate the importance of that cooperation. </p><p> The Netherlands is China's second-biggest trading partner in the European Union. </p><p> The volume of trade between our countries was almost 40 billion euros in 2012. </p><p> Between 2004 and 2012, Dutch investments in China increased almost tenfold, to 12 billion euros. </p><p> Around one thousand Dutch companies now operate in China. </p><p> While over 350 Chinese companies have set up shop in the Netherlands. And on both sides the numbers are rising. </p><p> The differences between our two countries - even if only in terms of size - are bridged by what unites us: an enterprising spirit, a business mindset, and a pragmatic, result-focused approach. </p><p> This underpins our countries' joint success. </p><p> The Netherlands is a small country doing big business. </p><p> We are the 17th-biggest economy and the world's second- biggest agricultural exporter. </p><p> A quick look at the map shows that this is no mean achievement. </p><p> In fields like agri-food, life sciences and water technology, Dutch firms are among the global leaders. </p><p> And as the gateway to Europe, the Netherlands plays an important role in the world economy. </p><p> Almost half of China's exports to Europe enter via the port of Rotterdam or Amsterdam Airport. </p><p> Looking in the opposite direction, the Netherlands has great respect for the lightning pace of China's development. </p><p> Everything here is expressed in big numbers: 1.3 billion inhabitants, over 120 cities with over one million people, and growth figures that have been about 10 per cent for decades. </p><p> In four decades your country has become the world's second-largest economy. </p><p> And with your consistently high growth figures it seems only a matter of time before you are number one. </p><p> This massive achievement has lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty. </p><p> On the global stage too, China is assuming a role that befits its status of economic and political superpower. </p><p> The Netherlands has a high regard for China's contribution. </p><p> Soon our countries will stand shoulder-to-shoulder in the UN mission in Mali. </p><p> And in the fight against international piracy we are also working towards a common goal. </p><p> We greatly value this cooperation. </p><p> At the same time, China's rapid economic rise also poses new challenges. </p><p> The same challenges we often face in Europe, but sometimes in a different form. </p><p> For instance, how can we use state-of-the-art infrastructure to keep our cities and industrial centres accessible? </p><p> How can we make sure that the air we breathe, the food we eat and the water we drink are clean and safe? </p><p> And what effect will our rapidly aging population have on health care? </p><p> In tackling these challenges, it is good to hear about each other's experiences and solutions. </p><p> We are keen to learn from you. </p><p> And the Netherlands has very specific knowledge in some of these fields that we would be pleased to share. </p><p> Ladies and gentlemen, the exciting story of China's rise as a global economic power is captivating the world. </p><p> And the Netherlands is very able and more than willing to join China on this historic journey. </p><p> Good and frequent contacts at the highest political level are very important in this regard. </p><p> But it's businesses like yours - big and small - that make a difference in today's economies. </p><p> It's business people like you that take risks and make things happen. Your partnerships and your success will not only shape the future of your own company but the development of both our countries. </p><p> I am very keen to hear what you have to say. </p><p> What opportunities exist? </p><p> What barriers do we still need to take away? </p><p> What is your view on building an even closer working relationship between our two countries? </p><p> Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is yours. </p><p> Thank you.</p>",8
120,"<p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Welcome to the Netherlands, and welcome especially to The Hague.</p><p>As the legal capital of the world, this city is also a symbol for children’s rights. So there is no better place to award the International Children’s Peace Prize each year. Norway is the home of the Nobel Peace Prize,and the Netherlands is the home of the Children’s Peace Prize. And that’s something we are very proud of.</p><p>In the Dutch newspapers, I recently read about a new cartoon superhero, or rather superheroine: Pakistan’s Burka Avenger. Dressed in a shiny black veil, she fights for the right of girls to go to school. In everyday life, the Burka Avenger is actually a primary school teacher. But if she sees one of her girls under attack, she turns into a superhero who silences her opponents. Not with violence, but with books and pens as weapons. Children in Pakistan can now enjoy her adventures on TV.</p><p>Pakistan’s real superhero, of course, is not a cartoon character. In fact, she is here with us today. Malala, before the eyes of the international media, you dared to speak up for the right to education. And you didn’t let a cowardly and appalling attack stop you. That requires the courage of a superhero. There are very few people like you in the world. I am delighted and honoured that you and your family could join us in the Netherlands today.</p><p>All around the world, people are talking about the Malala effect. Take six-year-old Fatima from the village of Kot Lakhpat near the Pakistani city of Lahore. She is now able to go to school for the first time. Because her mother was inspired by your story, Malala. By what happened to you.</p><p>So you see, something positive has come out of that terrible attack. Thanks to you, many girls in Pakistan and other countries are now going to school. Ladies and gentlemen, Malala is fighting for something very important. Education is not only vital for individual children, but also for society as whole. It is an essential weapon in the battle against poverty, disease and conflict. And it is the key to democracy and economic development. That’s why the international community needs to have sky-high ambitions in this field.</p><p>Mr Brown, as the UN’s Special Envoy for Global Education, described that ambition as follows: 'We want to be the first generation in history where every child is able to go to school and to learn.' And that’s an ambition I share. Because worldwide, 57 million children still do not go to school. And 300 million children are taught so badly that they don’t learn to read and write. And most of them are girls. They are not allowed to go to school, or are forced to marry very young and are taken out of school. Yet giving girls an education can at least double a country’s potential. </p><p>I was in Afghanistan earlier this year. Despite the real progress that has been made there over the past ten years, there are still far too few girls going to school. Since 2002, the Netherlands has been trying to help. By building new schools in Uruzgan, for example.</p><p>Simple things make all the difference. Training women teachers encourages more families to let their daughters go to school. So does building separate toilets for girls and offering community-based education.</p><p>Fortunately, we are seeing positive results. The number of primary school-age children not going to school halved between 2000 and 2011. That is a fundamental change.</p><p>And now for the other half. Because every child deserves the chance to unlock their full potential. And that is the reason behind this gathering. The International Children’s Peace Prize offers a platform for children who are fighting injustice in the world. Children who help the world progress and make it a better place.</p><p>This prize gives them the recognition, the publicity and the resources they need to fight for what they believe in. These children are already making a difference. Showing that you don’t have to be an adult to make your mark on the world. Malala, you gave an impressive speech to the UN in July. You said that ‘one child, one teacher, one book, and one pen can change the world’. And you are living proof of that.</p><p>It is an honour for this city to be able to present this prize for the ninth time to a young citizen of the world. A young citizen who has the courage to speak out and call the world to action. </p><p>Let me close by saying this to all the nominees and winners of the Children’s Peace Prize: you are all superheroes.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",1
121,"<p>Your Majesty, </p><p> Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations, </p><p> Your Excellencies, </p><p> ladies and gentlemen, mesdames et messieurs,</p><p>Welcome to the Netherlands, bienvenue aux Pays-Bas.</p><p>The Hague is not only the 'legal capital of the world' and the seat of the Dutch government; it is also the city of my youth. So the striking outline of this fine building is a familiar sight for me. I still remember my first visit to the Peace Palace with my father when I was a child. Even then it made a big impression on me, especially the grand hall, with its immense staircase and impressive stained-glass windows and mosaic floor. As a child, I had no doubt whatsoever: this was what a palace should look like.</p><p>This very special childhood memory makes it an even bigger honour to address you today, on the hundredth anniversary of the Peace Palace. I do so with pride, as a resident of this city and as prime minister of a country that has championed a stable international legal order since the days of Hugo Grotius,. The long international tradition is tied to the Netherlands' history as a seafaring trading nation. Grotius still enjoys worldwide fame for his pioneering work on the law of the sea and the law of war. How fitting that today - the 28th of August - is also the anniversary of his death.</p><p>In his famous work De Jure Belli ac Pacis from 1625, Grotius wrote: 'Where judicial settlement fails, war begins.' On this occasion, and in this setting, these words are almost prophetic. Because using justice to prevent violence lies at the heart of everything that has happened here for the past hundred years. The importance the world community attaches to this role is underlined by the presence in The Hague of the International Court of Justice as a world court and a principal organ of the UN. </p><p>A day like this naturally raises many questions. After 100 years, where do we stand? What has been achieved? And what still needs to be done? This building, however beautiful and impressive it may be, is ultimately no more than a collection of bricks, furniture and works of art. The International Court of Justice and the Permanent Court of Arbitration are housed here, along with the famous international law library and the Hague Academy of International Law. But the significance of the Peace Palace is broader. It has become a symbol of the rule of law worldwide and an icon of The Hague as international city of peace and justice. Intellectually and legally, the tribunals and the International Criminal Court are closely connected with this building, even though they carry out their work elsewhere.</p><p>And that is what this commemoration is all about. The work of the people and institutions connected with this building and the positive influence it has on the lives of millions of men, women and children. Their names and faces may not be familiar to us. But it is they who give real meaning to this building and everything it stands for.</p><p>Because their stories, often too terrible to imagine, support the picture of the twentieth century as an age of horror. And that picture is justified. The First and Second World Wars brought destruction on an unprecedented scale. Cities bombed to the ground, millions and millions of victims, the concentration camps and genocide - it is still hard to believe what people are capable of. And the world did not become a peaceful paradise after 1945. For a long time the Cold War cast a threatening shadow over the world. And new flashpoints and conflict areas have emerged ever since - as Syria shows today.</p><p>But there is also another story, a story of civilisation and humanity, of justice and hope. And that, too, is a hallmark of the twentieth century. It begins in this city, with the first and second Hague Peace Conferences and the opening of the Peace Palace in 1913. Looking back, Nobel laureates like Bertha von Suttner and Tobias Asser, and of course people like Andrew Carnegie, with their idealism and determination, started an unstoppable process. The formation of the Permanent Court of Arbitration showed that sovereign states were now willing to submit to international arbitration in order to resolve conflicts. In 1946 the International Court of Justice was established. It was given the task of settling legal disputes between states and giving advisory opinions. It has performed this task in an exemplary fashion, thereby preventing the lives of millions of people from being blighted by conflict. The formation of these institutions was also an explicit recognition that war was avoidable, and not a 'human state of mind', as had been thought for centuries.</p><p>Paradoxically, the development of the international legal order in the twentieth century took place in parallel with some of the most terrible, large-scale conflicts the world has ever seen. But that does not detract from what has been achieved over the past century, step by step, through trial and error. A hundred years ago many people could not imagine that courts would play a role in interstate relations and that it would be possible to bring people suspected of crimes against humanity before an international court. Nowadays we find this quite normal. But it is the result of a century's commitment to developing the rule of law.</p><p>Today, in this city alone, thousands of people of many different nationalities are advancing the ideal of a just and peaceful world. More than ever before in world history, the international community is able to settle disputes peacefully and take action if the rule of law is violated. The Peace Palace is the symbolic birthplace and the engine room of this process. And that is what we are celebrating today.</p><p>Today is also a good occasion for recognising how much work lies ahead. The current list of minor and major international conflicts is long. Careful international legal proceedings are far from simple and therefore take time. So I agree with you, Mr Secretary-General, that the rule of law deserves even more attention and commitment. In 2012 you presented an action programme to the UN General Assembly for this purpose. The institutions and organisations exist. The international conventions also exist. What we need today is for countries - both individually, and collectively within the UN - to actively ensure that agreements are complied with and improvements made where necessary. </p><p> This includes bolstering the position of women and children, improving national legal systems and fighting corruption. You, Mr Secretary-General, addressed all these issues last year.</p><p>The Dutch government fully supports the action programme. After all, article 90 of the Dutch Constitution states: 'The government shall promote the development of the international legal order.' We take this ongoing task very seriously. That is why the Netherlands has traditionally, with pride and conviction, offered its hospitality to a large number of worthy international legal institutions. Enhancing the peaceful international settlement of disputes is one of our key priorities, so I am pleased that your plan draws attention to this issue. This afternoon, my colleague Frans Timmermans will host a ministerial conference on this theme. The increasing importance of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in recent decades points to the growing need for peaceful dispute settlement. The work of the Permanent Court complements that of the International Court of Justice. And it deserves the highest praise for the way it has recently renewed itself by developing new arbitration rules for current disputes. We should applaud this. After all, prevention is always better than cure.</p><p>Another point in the action programme that I would like to highlight at this centennial celebration is the socioeconomic dimension of the rule of law. I am firmly convinced that a stable legal order and a robust economy go hand in hand. Even Hugo Grotius knew that. Security, legal certainty, personal development and enterprise are all interconnected. People who do not have to fear injustice and violence on a daily basis will be more willing to invest in their own and in their country's future. </p><p> And businesses that want to invest in another part of the world will only do so if they are confident of a safe return on their money. A growing number of international companies are taking their corporate social responsibility seriously, and no longer do business with countries or partners that do not respect the law. They do this out of conviction and also because CSR is an investment that yields a return. In short: a stable international legal order is a precondition for growth and development. This message deserves much more emphasis internationally. And as the global economy becomes more and more interwoven, there are new opportunities and platforms. So let's get the message out there!</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>The establishment of the Peace Palace a hundred years ago was certainly an act of idealism. But it was an act of practical idealism, focused on reality and results. And it continues to inspire us. I welcome the fact that on 21 September, during a one-off running event called the 'Vredesloop' or 'Peace Run', thousands of runners will translate their commitment to the Peace Palace and its important work into a sporting performance. So the message that this centennial sends to the rest of the world is clear: peace, security and legal certainty will continue to demand commitment, perseverance and dedication over the next hundred years.</p><p>Andrew Carnegie himself once described the Peace Palace as 'the most holy building in the world - because it has the holiest end in view'. Let us continue to make the same uncompromising commitment to peace, justice and human dignity.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",3
122,"<p>Ambassador Marsudi, ladies and gentlemen, ibu-ibu dan bapak-bapak,</p><p>Selamat sore, hello, and terima kasih: thank you for inviting me to be here for the 68th anniversary of the Proklamasi of 17 August 1945. The day the Republic of Indonesia declared its independence.</p><p>The Netherlands and Indonesia are closely related. Our histories are interwoven. You can see it in the signs for kantor pos you find in Jakarta. In the 400,000 Dutch nationals with Indonesian roots. In the Villa Isola in Bandung, designed by Dutch architect Wolff Schoemaker. And in the many Indonesian tokos in the Netherlands.</p><p>Our shared past has been turbulent. We can't ignore that reality on a day like this. But we have been through this experience together, and together we have come out on the other side. Today we can again show that Indonesia and the Netherlands have not only a shared past but also a shared future. Two sovereign nations, each with its own territorial integrity. We can show that we stand side-by-side, looking ahead. I consider it a special honour that I – as prime minister of the Netherlands – have been invited to join the Independence Day celebrations here at the embassy. Thank you again.</p><p>My own personal history is also tied up with your country. My father moved to Jakarta in the early 1930s. He, his first wife and their three children spent the war there, in Japanese camps. After the war, he and his second wife – my mother – returned to Indonesia and remained there until the 1950s.</p><p>Although I have never been to Indonesia myself, I feel a connection. Almost as if I’d lived there. It’s partly because of my childhood and my life in The Hague – the most Indonesian city in the Netherlands. It's no secret that the restaurant Soeboer is one of my all-time favourites. But mainly it’s down to my father, who never got tired of telling me stories of his life in Indonesia, and to the nasi goreng my mother made every Saturday for dinner. I remember she always used to buy her spices from Bali, a restaurant in Scheveningen.</p><p>I admit I’m a bit nostalgic, but I’m not the only one. Ten per cent of Dutch people have some kind of link with Indonesia. Every year, tens of thousands of Dutch tourists travel to your beautiful country. Our shared history, community and culture are great assets. And starting from that shared past, our countries have a lot to offer each other in the future, too.</p><p>Because alongside our historical and emotional bond, we also have firm economic ties. Thanks to Schiphol airport and the port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands is Indonesia's gateway to Europe. In 2012 we were the sixth-biggest investor in Indonesia – to the tune of one billion dollars. Within the EU, the Netherlands is Indonesia's top export destination and second-biggest trade partner. Many Dutch companies are based in Indonesia. In fact, Indonesia is a key market for companies like Unilever and FrieslandCampina.</p><p>The give-and-take between our countries is also reflected in our cultural relations. Dutch and Indonesian culture come together at the Erasmus Huis in Jakarta. And since the 1950s, more than 20,000 Indonesians have studied in the Netherlands. Many Dutch students have found their way to Indonesia too.</p><p>For years now, water management has been a vital area of cooperation between us. The benefits are mutual: by working closely with Indonesia to help protect Jakarta from flooding, the Netherlands is also learning a lot about the kinds of flood risks we could face in the future. So it’s good news for both countries that our cooperation agreements in this area were recently renewed and reinforced.</p><p>Despite these difficult economic times, Indonesia is doing well. And I admire your success. Your economy is growing and poverty is declining, creating a growing middle class. Since the Reformasi you have also made substantial progress in enhancing the legal order. In doing so, Indonesia has shown that a robust economy and a robust society feed into one another. This is all reflected in the increasingly prominent role Indonesia is playing on the world stage. It is an active and important member of the G20, the UN and, above all, ASEAN.</p><p>Minister Timmermans visited your country in February this year. And I’m delighted that I will be visiting Indonesia myself in November, along with a large Dutch business delegation. There we will reaffirm our comprehensive partnership agreement, with an eye to the future and our economic relations. It will be the first visit by a Dutch prime minister since 2006. So it’s about time! After all, face to face contacts are vital for the long-term success of our relationship.</p><p>I’m looking forward to my visit, for personal as well as professional reasons. But I realise, of course, that the Indonesia of my father’s fond tales has now evolved into a global economic and political powerhouse.</p><p>Let us raise a glass to the ties that bind us, and to the future success of our countries’ partnership.</p><p>Terima kasih.</p>",6
123,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p>At first glance, Texas and the Netherlands don’t seem to have a lot in common. For us, faraway Texas evokes images of cowboys, saloons and vast plains.

While the Netherlands is small, everything in Texas is big, bigger, biggest. </p><p>Yet two Dutch families by the name of Rienstra and Doornbos, who settled in Texas in 1897, saw something of their country here.

The town still exists today, complete with a tulip festival, windmill and dyke, or so I’ve heard.</p><p>Perhaps the town’s founders sensed that one day the Netherlands and Texas would establish close ties. Because our differences aren’t as big as they may seem. In fact, we have a lot in common. Texas is world famous for its oil and gas, and the Dutch-Flemish delta region has an unrivalled position in the petrochemical industry. The Dutch chemical industry, for example, has a positive trade balance of 24 billion euros. One reason for this success is our long tradition in this field, which has helped us build up an excellent knowledge base. Together, the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam form the gateway to Europe. Excellent connections to the rest of Europe make the delta region a major hub for imports and exports. And many companies, including businesses from Texas, make use of it for their raw materials and for logistics. Just as the Port of Houston is the gateway to America. </p><p>The success of our petrochemical cluster is partly due to our close relations with companies from Texas. We are proud of this success and we want to build on it. That’s why we’re investing more in innovation and expanding our port facilities and logistics services. To achieve this we are stepping up partnership between government, businesses and universities. In the Netherlands and Flanders, and here in Texas. </p><p>Some 110 Dutch companies are already active in your state, including big names like Shell, AkzoNobel and Heineken. And Flemish people can be found in senior positions at ExxonMobil. The Belgian-Dutch region is the second-biggest investor in the United States, investing 17 times more in your country than China, Brazil, India and Russia put together. Incredible, really, when you look at a map of the world. We may be small in size, but when it comes to trade and investment we can match almost any country. </p><p>At the same time, the United States is the biggest direct investor in the Netherlands, with Texas as the number-one state.</p><p>Let me give you a few more figures. Dutch investment and trade has created 680,000 jobs in the US, with no fewer than 100,000 in Texas. The total trade volume between Texas and our delta region is 15 billion dollars. So the Lone Star State is vital to trade relations between our countries. </p><p>Of course, there’s always room for improvement. And that’s why we’re here. Kris Peeters and I have brought along some of our colleagues and a large business delegation from Flanders and the Netherlands. Our aim? To make this relationship even better and more profitable for everyone involved.</p><p>With this in mind, I am very pleased that the United States and the EU have decided to start negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. We want to achieve even lower tariffs for importers and exporters. We want to create more uniform standards and procedures to make things less complicated for American and European entrepreneurs. And we want to provide better access to each other’s markets. The result will be more growth, more jobs and more prosperity for Texas, Flanders and the Netherlands. </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I understand that the name Texas comes from the Caddo tribe word ‘tejas’, meaning friends or allies. We’ve been friends, or tejas, for a long time now. It’s no coincidence that we were among the first countries to establish diplomatic ties with your state when it gained its independence. The Dutch flag flying at the Institute of Texan Cultures in San Antonio is evidence of this. Cooperation between Flanders, the Netherlands and Texas and between our companies has solid foundations. I have no doubt that this joint mission and this gathering here today will make our friendship and our partnership even stronger. </p><p>Thank you.</p><p>I shall now give the floor to my Flemish colleague Kris Peeters. </p>",0

125,"<p>Ambassador Levin, Ms King, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>First of all: it’s good to be back in Chicago. I’ve been here once before, for an ice cream conference held in 2002 by Unilever, my employer at the time. Since then a lot has changed in Chicago and in my career. But two things have remained the same: the curse of the Billy Goat and my love of ice cream. When I first came here I could never have imagined that, one day, I would have the honour of addressing the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. So thank you for inviting me. I’m looking forward to the discussion we’ll have shortly. But first a few words of introduction.</p><p>When I was preparing for today, I recalled something Margaret Thatcher, one of my all-time favourite politicians, once said. ‘Europe will never be like America’, she said. ‘Europe is a product of history. America is a product of philosophy.’ It’s a great quote, one of many that the Iron Lady has to her name. But speaking as a former student of history, I’ve never entirely agreed with her on this point. Of course there are real contrasts between Europe and the United States: economic, political, social and cultural. But it is history, our historical ties, that make our differences minor compared with what we have in common.</p><p>Take, for instance, your historical ties with my country, the Netherlands. Here are a few facts. The Pilgrim Fathers found refuge in the Dutch town of Leiden before setting sail for the New World in 1620. New York was originally founded as New Amsterdam, a Dutch trading post. The Netherlands was the first country, 230 years ago, to establish diplomatic relations with the United States. And you can even trace a direct line between the American Declaration of Independence and our own Act of Abjuration. That’s the document that marked the birth of the Dutch Republic, in which the Dutch provinces rejected their Spanish overlord, King Philip II, in 1581. It was the first time a people had ‘deposed’ a monarch in such a way. In that sense ‘our’ King Philip was ‘your’ King George. Of course, there are many more historical connections like this and they also involve other European countries.</p><p>But it was only in the twentieth century that those historical ties grew into a unique form of transatlantic solidarity. The First and Second World Wars, and the Cold War that followed, brought America and Europe ever closer together: from a political, military and economic point of view. Right up to the present day. It was and remains an alliance based on a number of fundamental shared values: democracy, freedom, the rule of law and a belief in free market principles. No wonder President Obama speaks of Europe as ‘the cornerstone of our engagement with the world’. I can assure you that for Europe, and certainly for the Dutch government, the reverse is equally true.</p><p>But even an alliance built on such strong foundations has to be maintained. We must never take the transatlantic relationship for granted. And that’s the key message I bring with me to Chicago. That it’s vital that the US and Europe continue working on their relationship, to keep it up to date. Because we need you, and you need us. Because in our dealings with other countries we are better off working together than by ourselves. But also because the world around us is changing continuously and changing circumstances demand action. The debt crisis in Europe, America’s economic prospects, the rise of the BRICs, the Arab Spring, the alarming situations in countries like Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan and, of course, Syria: these developments all impact on each other and on the transatlantic relationship.</p><p>This week’s NATO summit in this beautiful city will explore some of these topics. But the transatlantic relationship goes beyond safety and security. There is at least one other dimension that deserves our constant attention. I’m talking, of course, about the economy. These two dimensions reinforce each other. It’s a two-way street. The more we can increase safety and security in the world, the better America and Europe can promote their shared international economic interests – and the more people in other countries will gain access to global markets. So NATO’s strategic military alliance and our transatlantic economic cooperation are directly connected. I’d like to say a few words about each dimension.</p><p>First, the economy. Because in spite of all the economic problems we need to solve in our own countries and our own region, we should never forget the importance of the economic relations that exist between America and Europe. Or how dynamic those relations are. Let’s look at the facts: the US and Europe jointly account for about half of global GDP. That’s enormous. The mutual flow of goods and services is worth 2.7 billion dollars every day. This equals 15 million jobs on both sides of the ocean. What’s more, direct investment by America in Europe, and direct investment by Europe in America, greatly outweigh their investment in any other region in the world.</p><p>The figures for my own country are no less impressive. The US is the biggest foreign investor in the Netherlands. But, more surprising perhaps, the Netherlands – a country whose economy ranks number 16 in the world, which covers an area only a tenth of California, and which has fewer inhabitants than Florida ¬– is the third biggest investor in the US. Or to put it differently, about 625,000 American jobs are created by Dutch investment in the US and US exports to the Netherlands. That’s more or less the population of Washington, DC.</p><p>I could go on. There are many more figures which tell the same story. But I think the point is clear. The question now is: how can we expand our relationship? How can we – by working even closer together – create more high-value jobs and make ourselves more competitive in international markets? These are the questions we should keep in mind as we make our way through the current crisis and beyond. And I’m pleased to say that the American government thinks the same way. When I visited President Obama last November, we quickly agreed that only three topics really mattered: jobs, jobs and more jobs.</p><p>That’s why the Netherlands attaches such importance to the joint High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth. The figures I just mentioned make it clear that even a small improvement in transatlantic economic cooperation can have a big positive impact. Greater economic integration, more free trade and the removal of trade barriers can provide an enormous stimulus to our economies. A deep and comprehensive free trade agreement would boost the national incomes of the United States and Europe by many billions of dollars and euros per year. Of course you can’t set up a free trade zone overnight. But there are strong arguments for working step by step towards that goal. And the Netherlands is keen to take those steps.</p><p>Improving economic cooperation is also important from another perspective. Both the US and Europe stand to gain by promoting the strong and stable development of the emerging economies in Asia and South America. And we know from experience that  you need more than just good growth figures. A strong economy is built on a strong society. A society in which people have sufficient confidence in the future to invest in themselves by means of education. To buy houses and consumer goods. To save, to start a business, to take part in society. In that sense democratic principles, the free market, human rights and the rule of law have a direct bearing on a country’s prosperity and the welfare of its people.</p><p>America and Europe can play a more effective role here by acting together, from a position of strength. Together we are better placed to guide other countries towards stable socioeconomic development. Together we can also do more to shape the development and growth of global trade along free market lines. That sounds idealistic, but we can do it by staying realistic and taking one step at a time. So I’m not calling for the overzealous promotion of democracy and high moral standards. What I am saying is that we should encourage, recognise and also reward steps in the right direction. Like the current US government and the European Union are doing in Myanmar, to give you just one example.</p><p>So we need to step up our economic cooperation and we need to join forces in our dealings with third countries. That, in a nutshell, is how I think we should move forward, now that Europe is no longer America’s geopolitical focus of attention. To be fair, our new position does take a bit of getting used to. But I also see it as proof that, in American eyes, the European Union has attained a certain maturity, despite our problems with the euro. And with maturity comes responsibility. There is no reason why Europe should shy away from that. Now Europe is fixing what needs to be fixed in its monetary system and also looks beyond this crisis for new opportunities for growth and jobs. As you may have noticed: that is a work in progress.</p><p>Of course, the shift in emphasis in US foreign policy also has a direct influence on developments within NATO, which we’ll be talking about this week. And let me be frank: it’s understandable that the division of costs is being called into question. The outspoken farewell speech delivered by former Defence Secretary Gates in Brussels did not pass unnoticed in Europe. As you know, three quarters of the NATO bill is paid by the United States and a quarter by Europe. At the same time, because of the crisis, defence budgets everywhere are being tightened – also in the US. And we’re facing new kinds of threats, like cyberterrorism, which conventional military means aren’t equipped to deal with. So we’re being squeezed on two fronts: financial and strategic.</p><p>Against this backdrop, I’m pleased that NATO and this NATO summit are aiming towards innovation and smart solutions on both fronts. The Netherlands, for example, is a strong advocate of ‘smart defence’. And we aim to be one of the lead nations in this field. By working together even closer, by sharing information better and sooner, we can increase the return on our NATO investment in terms of people and resources. In short, we can get greater value for the same money. The Netherlands has positive experiences  with smart defence that perhaps can be put to use in developing the concept. For instance, since the mid-nineties there has been a Dutch-German army corps and for some time now the Dutch navy has been working closely together with its Belgian counterpart.</p><p>As regards the specific role we play in NATO, the Netherlands has a reputation for being a reliable and active partner. And we intend to keep it that way. Within NATO, but also elsewhere. For instance, we were recently delighted to say ‘yes’ when asked to host the next Nuclear Security Summit – an initiative of President Obama which has our firm backing.</p><p>At the same time, it’s true that the defence budget has been cut back in my country too for a number of years now. But that has not stopped us, for instance, playing an important role in Afghanistan. Up to the end of 2010 we had a strong military presence of 2,000 personnel in Uruzgan. Now we are helping the Afghans by conducting a police training mission in Kunduz. And looking beyond 2014, it is clear that the need for international involvement will remain. As before, the Netherlands stands ready to make a contribution. A contribution that takes full account of the responsibility and independence of the Afghans themselves. And one in which the ‘Dutch trademark’ will again be recognisable. Because the Netherlands always opts for an integrated approach, in which all elements interconnect. Security and justice, development and enterprise, freedom and responsibility.</p><p>And so, ladies and gentlemen, in about 20 minutes we’ve gone from the ice cream business, via history and the economy, to international peace and security. That sounds like a complicated journey, but in the end my message centres on two ideas: dialogue and cooperation. That is what made the transatlantic relationship strong in the past, and that is what can help us move forward in the future. We do have similar interests and a similar cultural background, but I’m not saying that Margaret Thatcher was talking nonsense. She was right that Europe and America will never be perfectly alike. But they are perfectly complementary. Which is even better.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",17
126,"<p>Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Last year, the British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, appeared on Dutch television. In fluent Dutch, he said he would like to visit the Netherlands more often. He talked about his Dutch relatives, and his close ties with our country. Now, I understand that you don't all have relatives in the Netherlands, or speak the language. So it's my pleasure to tell you why you should come to the Netherlands as well. And why you would be more than welcome.</p><p>First and foremost: the Dutch government and the Dutch business community are strongly committed to global trade, the free market and being a fair and reliable business partner. And it's no coincidence that we are meeting here in London, because international trade and entrepreneurship have been a driving force in both the Netherlands and the UK ever since the seventeenth century. Anglo-Dutch companies like Shell, AKZO/ICI, Unilever and Reed Elsevier are active all over the planet. From our small corner of the globe, large investments are moving back and forth all over the world. And the people behind it, innovative entrepreneurs like yourselves, have plenty of ideas for creating even more added value in the future.  So I don't think I need to convince you that in economic heavy weather it is essential to boost economic cooperation across borders.</p><p>Against this backdrop, I am very pleased that we'll be talking tonight about doing business in the Netherlands. Some of you already know from experience what the Netherlands has to offer international enterprises. Let me assure you that we highly appreciate your vital contribution to the Dutch economy. More than 30% of the total business turnover in the Netherlands is generated by foreign-owned companies that are active in our country. And I hope that those of you who are not yet investing in the Netherlands will soon find out why this is a good idea. </p><p>Because doing business in the Netherlands means doing business in a prime, strategic location. Many international businesses have already set up their headquarters in our country, but there’s always room for more. From our world-class sea port in Rotterdam and from Amsterdam airport, markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are within easy reach. Combined with our competitive fiscal climate and innovative technological infrastructure, that makes the Netherlands popular with our foreign partners. And that means you, I hope.</p><p>The entrepreneurial spirit that has been a driving force in our country for many hundreds of years has brought us where we are today. The Netherlands has the sixteenth biggest economy in the world. We are always open to the outside world. We like to look beyond our borders in search of new opportunities for our trading partners. What's more, 85% of the Dutch speak English, and many speak a third or even fourth language. That will make life easy for you.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Let me conclude by saying that of course I look forward to running into Nick Clegg again on one of his visits to the Netherlands. But it would give me great pleasure to run into you or one of your fellow entrepreneurs in the Netherlands in the very near future as well.</p><p>You are more than welcome.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",4
127,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Growing interdependence is a fact of life of the contemporary world. It transcends and influences national systems. It requires new and more intensive forms of international cooperation to realize its benefits and to counteract economic and political nationalism.</p><p>I am sure you recognise these words – the opening lines of your own founding declaration of 1973. I quote them because it’s striking how relevant they still are today. More relevant than ever, one could argue, even though now, nearly four decades after the Trilateral Commission was set up, the world looks completely different.</p><p>Back then, in 1973, we faced the real dangers posed by the Cold War and a global arms race which took on absurd proportions. It was the time of 'ping pong diplomacy' between the United States and China. And of the oil crisis and the alarming report by the Club of Rome. The US had just broken the link between the dollar and the price of gold. And Europe did not yet have open borders or a single market, let alone a common currency. That was all in the future.</p><p>Now, nearly four decades later, the younger generation only know about the Iron Curtain from their history lessons. The same goes for the Dutch guilder, the Deutschmark and the Italian lira. Now, the means of communication are almost unlimited and the world is more of a 'global village' than ever. In the past few decades we have also seen 'the end of ideology' and the rise of democracy and free trade. It’s a slow but ongoing process, and there’s no turning back. You talked about this earlier today in your session on the Arab awakening.</p><p>Because of these developments, countries and regions are growing closer, economically, culturally and socially. China and Russia are no longer the closed societies of the past. India, Brazil and others are asserting themselves as fast rising economic powers. And Europe? Well, despite the current problems we are facing, Europe can certainly point to great achievements in the brief period after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It took in a large number of new member states. It brought about the free movement of people and goods within the EU. And it introduced the euro. We have all gained from these achievements. And especially a country like ours, because foreign trade has been our bread and butter ever since the 16th century.</p><p>Which brings me to my central message tonight: that our still-growing interdependence demands a certain kind of behaviour from countries and their political leaders. In the famous words of Winston Churchill: 'The price of greatness is responsibility'. This means that countries and regions that want to enter the global market and play a role on the international stage have to realise that influence is a two-way street. Besides self-interest, there is always a common interest and a shared responsibility. Take for instance stability on the financial markets. The financial and economic crisis of 2008 and what followed made absolutely clear that in today’s world, everything is interconnected. When a small part of the American mortgage market sneezed in 2008, the entire global economy caught a severe cold. And it has still not recovered.</p><p>So I believe that China and Europe have every right to call the US to account for its enormous national debt. And that the international community is right to encourage Russia to join the World Trade Organization. As we are right to ask China to let the yuan be freely bought and sold. And  yes, by the same token, it is only logical that the rest of the world is keeping a close eye on Europe, and is insisting that we fix the problems with the euro as soon as possible.</p><p>The Dutch position is clear. Our long international tradition obliges us to play an active role on the world stage. This tradition is almost tangible, especially here in The Hague, the home of the Peace Palace and the legal capital of the world. We feel the same sense of responsibility  towards Europe, perhaps even more keenly. Remember that the Netherlands is one of the six founding nations of the European Union. Back then, in the first post-war years, the prevailing mood was 'No more war!' / 'Nie wieder Krieg!' Now, some 60 years on, our minds are focused on the euro and the economy. You will talk more about that tomorrow with a number of leading actors. Unfortunately I can’t join you, so if I may I will have my say now.</p><p>Europe and the euro have been on a rollercoaster ride. And let's hope that the decisions we took at the summit of 26 and 27 October will mean no more looping-the-loop. What we need now is realism and decisive action. Of course, from the perspective of international law and culture, European cooperation is still an ideal worth striving for. That hasn’t changed since the Second World War. But what Europeans want most from their leaders now is practical and concrete prospects of economic growth and prosperity. Of stable pay and pensions. And a future for their children. I firmly believe that this is Europe’s core task.</p><p>Let me put it this way: for Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer and their generation, 'Europe' was all about securing a lasting peace. A goal they achieved by joining up Europe’s national economies. By turning their backs on mutual suspicion and protectionism, and embracing mutual profit. For our generation, the priority should be to safeguard and expand our existing prosperity. We can achieve that by taking the next step on good governance and moving forward on a European growth strategy.</p><p>And you know what they say: 'Never waste a good crisis.' So now's the time to make sure that we never again see a repeat of the current problems with the euro. That's why the Netherlands proposed appointing a European Commissioner for budget discipline: a man or woman with a mandate to act if euro countries fail to stick to the budgetary agreements in the Stability and Growth Pact, the SGP. Under our proposal, countries in that situation would face increasingly severe and automatic sanctions. Because we have all seen where slack financial discipline leads in a currency union. Never again! That's our message. It’s time we took the 'S' in SGP seriously. So I'm pleased that the Dutch proposal has been well received and that we can now take steps to put it into practice.</p><p>At the same time, we also have to get serious about the 'G' in SGP. Because having budget discipline without getting our economies to grow would be like buying a shiny new car with a scooter engine. It would look good, but it wouldn't really get you anywhere. That's why, in recent months, the Netherlands has consistently stressed that Greece and other countries not only need to get their budgets in order, but also need to carry out structural reforms to boost their economies. Like measures on pensions and taxation. In our country we have made a start by raising the pension age in stages from 65 to 67. These are not popular measures, but they are urgently needed. And as I said earlier, besides our own interests, we also have a shared responsibility; countries are entitled to hold their European partners to account.</p><p>In addition, Europe as a whole must have a concrete agenda for growth, to boost prosperity and employment. Only recently I wrote a joint letter on this subject to Manuel Barroso and Herman van Rompuy, together with my Swedish and Finnish colleagues Fredrik  Reinfeldt and Jyrki Katainen. We believe we should take action soon. For example by completing the internal market for services across the EU and finally reaching agreement on a European patent. It can be done and it can be done quickly. And to be frank, I don’t think Europe can afford to just wait and see. There's work to be done.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, that is the Europe to which the Netherlands will continue to be fully committed. Because sixty years of cooperation proves that we are stronger when we act together than when we go it alone. It shows that Europe is a practical instrument we can use to improve the lives of people step by step. The same people that Jean Monnet spoke of when he famously remarked 'We are not bringing together states, we are uniting people'.</p><p>I would like to propose a toast to that idea: to the friendship between the people of our beautiful continent and to shared European success in the future. </p><p>Cheers.</p>",7
128,"<p> </p><p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>In 1983, at the age of 16, I visited Russia for the first time, together with my father. It was an unforgettable experience, which I have thought about often in the past few days. I was so impressed by the beauty of Leningrad, with the Hermitage and the canals inspired by Amsterdam. In Moscow, I was so impressed by the Kremlin, the Red Square and Lenin’s mausoleum, where you could almost reach out and touch 20th-century world history. But I was also moved by the sharp contrast between the splendour of the churches, palaces and museums, and the poverty in the streets. Back then, Russia was a closed and grey country. And even at that young age, I understood how essential personal freedom is to a country’s prosperity and its people’s happiness.</p><p> </p><p>Almost thirty years later, Russia has only grown more beautiful, while in other ways the country has changed radically – and for the better. The young people in this room only know the Soviet Union from the stories of their parents and grandparents. But what seemed unthinkable in 1983, so soon after Brezhnev’s lethargic ‘era of stagnation’, fast became reality. Democratic elections. Free contact with the outside world. And an economic system more open than ever before.</p><p> </p><p>Let me be clear from the start: is the process complete? No, certainly not. Have there been problems and economic shocks? Yes, there have. But looking back on the last twenty years, I can only express my admiration and respect for the incredible change Russia has undergone in such a short time. As a historian by training, I venture to say that few big countries have ever achieved anything similar. That is something to be proud of. And now the challenge is to keep moving forward. In spite of, or perhaps even because of, the uncertainty now facing the global economy.</p><p> </p><p>Yesterday I met with President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin. We discussed bolstering the economic partnership between the Netherlands and Russia. And during our talk, the watchword was ‘modernisation’. A word I’ve also heard Russian business leaders use in the past few days. Let me assure you firstly that I endorse that ambition, and secondly that the Netherlands wants to be an active and trusted partner in the process.</p><p> </p><p>This kind of partnership is part of a long tradition based on trade, shared knowledge and cultural engagement. Back in the early fifteen hundreds, Dutch ships were already sailing to Archangel via the Sound to trade in timber and hides. At the end of the century Peter the Great, no less, visited the Netherlands. He was fascinated by Dutch expertise in shipbuilding and water management. Today, the Netherlands is the largest foreign investor in Russia. Dozens of Dutch companies are active here, including global players like Philips and Shell. And our cultural ties have been closer than ever since the Hermitage Amsterdam was opened in 2009. I don’t know when we have received a more beautiful gift. In exchange, we gave you Guus Hiddink and Dick Advocaat. I will leave it to you to decide whether it was a good trade or not! But looking back at the recent qualification for Euro 2012 and at the 2007 Zenit championship, I imagine many of you would say yes!</p><p> </p><p>My point is that we have a solid foundation for building on our existing cooperation, trust and friendship. And in the Netherlands, we are very keen to do just that. So I have come to Russia with representatives of more than seventy Dutch companies, including several CEOs of multi-billion-dollar enterprises. They all see opportunities in Russia and they all plan to keep investing in a solid relationship that benefits partners in both countries.</p><p> </p><p>The Russian government’s modernisation plans are an important part of this. And although the ‘hardware’ of technology and infrastructure is important, the ‘software’ of people and society is even more vital. When President Medvedev spoke at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in June, he was very clear about this. His frankness and honesty made a deep impression. Yes, he spoke of Russia’s ambitious technological agenda but first and formemost he adressed problems of a very different kind. For example, he talked about building effective public administration and a reliable financial system. He spoke about the need to reduce bureaucracy and fight corruption. He argued that free enterprise needs more room to grow. And he spoke frankly about his plans to improve the judicial system and the rule of law in Russia. ‘My choice’, he said, ‘is a policy that gives millions of people maximum opportunities for economic activeness, and protects them with laws backed by the full weight of state power.’ This is very close to my own political convictions: that government should make things possible, not try to run people’s lives.</p><p> </p><p>In essence, President Medvedev’s speech was about confidence. It was about the rule of law and reliable institutions laying the foundation for economic growth and prosperity. And there is indeed a direct link here. Entrepreneurs are more willing to invest if they are confident that their business partners will honour their financial agreements. If inflation is low and confidence in the banks is high. And if they can be sure that a contract is worth something, because it can be enforced in reliable legal proceedings.</p><p> </p><p>The same is true for the people of Russia. Or any other country, for that matter. Almost anyone will work harder and invest more in their own future if they know they will be rewarded for their efforts. If they know the government and the law will protect them against unequal or arbitrary treatment. Building confidence is the best way to unleash creativity and enterprise. So investing in economic security and legal protection may be the best investment a country can make. It cuts both ways, after all. It encourages foreign investment and builds international trade relations. But it also helps to stop knowledge and capital moving abroad, because it gives people confidence in the future of their own country. Both are equally important in my view.</p><p> </p><p>So a lot depends on building confidence in institutions. On good governance at all levels. The international community understood this better than ever after the financial and economic crisis broke in 2008. Take for example the decisions the G20 have taken since then on reforming financial supervision. It’s all about good governance. The crisis has also made painfully clear how infectious problems in our globalised world can be. Do you remember how the crisis started? It began in the United States in the summer of 2008 with sub-prime mortgages. A difficult, but manageable problem, most analysts said at the time. A few months later, an economic fire was raging around the world. We are still feeling the effects today. And unfortunately we will feel them for some time to come.</p><p> </p><p>Which brings me to another important point. Countries and regions that are active in the world and want to play a major role on the world stage have to realise that influence entails responsibility. Economies around the world are so closely interwoven nowadays that it is only right that we ask every country to think about the impact their choices and behaviour have on other countries. That is particularly true of large and important players like Russia, China, the US and the European Union.</p><p> </p><p>Let me offer two current examples. The first concerns the Netherlands and the EU, and the second involves embedding Russia in the system of world trade. The first example, of course, is about the euro crisis. The reason for the current problems in the eurozone is that some countries have not kept to the agreements made when we introduced the euro. We agreed then that no one’s annual budget deficit would exceed three per cent and that the national debt could not be higher than sixty per cent of GNP. Unfortunately, those agreements were broken. Not only by Greece, though it was one of the worst offenders. To make matters worse, the other member states failed to intervene, mostly for political reasons. How could this happen? It happened because the system of sanctions we set up was not strict enough. So what we are now dealing with, is a serious flaw in our monetary union that has emerged since we introduced the single currency. </p><p> </p><p>This is bad news for everyone who pays in euros, everyone who has their savings in euros and everyone who has built up a pension in euros. But there are also risks for countries outside the eurozone. If consumer confidence falls in Europe, for example, global demand for goods will drop too. What’s more, governments and companies in other countries are owed money in euros. So the uncertainty and instability affecting our currency poses a serious risk to them too.</p><p> </p><p>Against this background, it is only right that the rest of the world should put pressure on Europe to get its affairs in order. To restore stability and confidence in the euro. The Netherlands recently submitted far-reaching proposals for this purpose. We want to introduce an automatic system of sanctions supervised by a special European Commissioner. Countries that do not stick to the rules will have to hand over increasing levels of sovereignty. That will be hard for some countries to swallow, but we need to get back to basics and make sure that this situation can never happen again. A deal is a deal. We owe that to our own people and we owe it to the rest of the world. Because new debt bubbles won’t be good for anyone.</p><p> </p><p>My second example, Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization, is another matter which transcends the interests of any one country. An economy the size and the importance of Russia’s, simply belongs in the WTO. Many countries, including the Netherlands, are convinced of that. No trade statistics are complete without data from Russia. And more importantly: WTO membership would not only be in keeping with Russia’s modernisation agenda, it would also bolster the stability and reliability of the international trade system. This would benefit many countries, including the Netherlands with its open, export-based economy.</p><p> </p><p>We hope that outstanding issues that currently stand in the way of accession could be resolved as soon as possible. And we trust that negotiations to this regard will be conducted in good faith. Because accession is too important to delay - for each country individually, for bilateral trade and for the wider world.</p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>The great Leo Tolstoy once wrote that, making laws is easier than governing. And he was right. Law-making is basically an administrative process. But governance – good governance – is far more than that. Especially in these times. Good governance is about honesty and transparency. It is about governments that are willing to face difficult choices and compromises. It’s about providing a climate of stability, legal certainty and reliability, in which people and businesses can flourish.</p><p> </p><p>In 1983, I saw with my own eyes how not to do it. I can see that a great deal has changed for the better in Russia since then. And I can also see that you have set the bar very high for the years ahead. So let us agree now that I will return in another thirty years to look back with you, the future leaders of this beautiful country, on the many successful initiatives started in this period. </p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p>",12
129,"<p> </p><p>Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>'Thanks to Russia, I became a citizen of the world,' said a Dutch businessman in a recent interview about his Russian years – words that show the impact this splendid country can have on people. The same businessman also had a few useful tips for others planning to do business in Russia. In short: do what you have to do; don't give up at the first setback; and hire local talent – that is, work together in a real sense. I couldn't give you a better advice today. But perhaps I should tell the Russian business people in this room that these tips also apply to Russians who want to do business in the Netherlands.</p><p> </p><p>You have a full day ahead of you. And a full programme. I think it's wonderful to see so many Dutch and Russian business people wanting to talk about so many important subjects. It proves that you not only see opportunities, you’re keen on seizing them as well. Mr Zubkov, it's also good to see you here today. Your presence again underlines the importance that Russia, like the Netherlands, attaches to bolstering our economic ties. As you know, the Netherlands has long been the biggest foreign investor in Russia. And we want to keep it that way – which is why these seminars are so important.</p><p> </p><p>A day like this also shows that innovative businesses have a major role to play in solving the problems facing Russia, the Netherlands, and other countries. Todays subjects include biomass, energy transport, life sciences, and infrastructure and mobility. So you will be talking about major future challenges that both our countries face: our energy supplies, our ageing populations, and clean, efficient transport. We urgently need the innovative technologies and solutions being devised and realised by the business community. And the best part is: you make a strong business case for them. Congratulations! </p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>Today is all about partnerships between Dutch and Russian businesses. We're here to embrace new ideas and make new contacts. To do business the old-fashioned way, but in new and exciting areas. I wish you all a very fruitful day. And I hope that you will leave with a pocket full of new business cards and a head full of new ideas.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p>",1
130,"<p> </p><p>Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>In Holland we have a saying that goes, 'You are never too old to learn'. And it’s true. While preparing for this trip, I learnt that Russian shipping is full of words that come from Dutch. Take words like 'ankor', 'mast', 'botsman' and 'sjkipper'. That makes us quite proud. But more important, it shows that, ever since the time of Peter the Great, Russia and Holland have been linked by trade and shared knowledge.</p><p> </p><p>This visit to Russia by me and my colleague Melanie Schultz, Minister of Infrastructure and the Environment, is part of that long tradition. It’s an honour to be in Russia and to join with Ambassador Ron Keller in welcoming so many guests this evening. A special welcome to you, Minister Nabiullina and Minister Levitin, and to you, Ambassador Kolodkin. Your presence at this trade dinner shows that you – like us – greatly value good Russian-Dutch relations. Thank you for coming.</p><p> </p><p>Having said this, I think we all agree that this evening is not about government officials but about boosting partnerships between Russian and Dutch businesses. Melanie Schultz and I came here with representatives of 70 businesses and the CEOs of a number of world-class companies. Together they represent the best of what the Dutch economy has to offer. They are all entrepreneurs who see opportunities in Russia and who want to invest in even better trade relations. So I am delighted also to welcome the crème de la crème of the Russian business community this evening. I’m sure that this meeting will lead to great things.</p><p> </p><p>For the Netherlands, Russia is a priority country because of its enormous potential. We see Russia as a growth market of over 140 million consumers and we warmly welcome the ambitious economic reforms undertaken by the Russian leaders. I hope to discuss this with President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>As one of the leading investors and exporters worldwide and as the 7th most competitive country in the world, the Netherlands has what it takes to be an important partner in this process. Take our state-of-the-art logistics sector – perhaps the strongest in the world. Take our expertise in agriculture, where we are the world’s second-largest exporter. Take our strong life sciences sector. And, finally, take our innovative energy sector, with its specialist offshore know-how in the most extreme conditions. All these and many other sectors are represented here this evening.</p><p> </p><p>As Russia’s largest investor, the Netherlands is open to more Russian investment in our country. Because we believe in open markets and cross-border partnership. We can offer Russian businesses a state-of-the-art, modern and outward-looking economy with, for example, the highest percentage of broadband connections in the world. But we also offer a spirit of enterprise based on centuries of experience and a tradition of reliability. Because in international commerce, reliability is key. So in the Netherlands a deal is a deal, and we do what we promise.</p><p> </p><p>I’m glad to say that, after a sharp dip in recent years, trade between Russia and the Netherlands is recovering well. In fact, it will soon reach pre-crisis levels. Holland is the number one destination for Russian products, with exports reaching 14 billion euros in 2010. In that same year, Dutch exports to Russia were around 6 billion euros. These are impressive figures that should encourage us to do even better in the future. We have come here believing that even greater success is within reach, for both Dutch and Russian businesses. So let us seize the opportunities before us – opportunities from which both our countries will benefit.</p><p> </p><p>Which brings me back to the aim of this dinner. I wish you an enjoyable meal and a highly productive evening that, hopefully, will lead to many new successful business ventures. And to underline this, I would like to propose a toast: to the friendship and partnership between Russia and the Netherlands. </p><p> </p><p>Na zdaróvje.</p>",3
131,"<p> </p><p>Ambassador Levin, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>On Tuesday 11 September 2001, at about five to nine in the morning, Ingeborg Lariby called her parents from her office on the 93rd floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center. She told them that a plane had crashed into the North Tower. But ‘I’m OK,’ she added. That phone call was the last time Ingeborg spoke to her parents. A few minutes later the second plane hit the South Tower.</p><p> </p><p>We all still remember where we were when we saw those horrifying images. At first there was a feeling of irrational hope, as if we were watching something that wasn’t really happening. But all too soon we faced the harsh reality, the plumes of smoke over Manhattan, the wailing of the sirens, the panic in the city streets, and finally the apocalyptic sight of the Twin Towers collapsing. The whole world was watching.</p><p> </p><p>[…]</p><p> </p><p>Ingeborg Lariby was only 42 when she died. Born in New York, of Dutch parents, she felt at home all over the world. ‘Native of the Netherlands, citizen of everywhere’ was how the New York Times described her. After years of travel, she had made Manhattan her home. That was where she achieved her professional ambitions. That was the base from which she stayed in touch with friends all over the world. That was where she enjoyed everything life and New York had to offer, which was a great deal.</p><p> </p><p>Today, ten years later, we remember Ingeborg Lariby and all the other people who were taken from us that day.</p><p> </p><p>Today we think back to that dark day when the unthinkable happened, when almost 3,000 people from more than 90 countries lost their lives in a series of cowardly terrorist attacks.</p><p> </p><p>And today, with all our heart, we reach out again to the families and friends of the victims. As we did ten years ago, when we mourned with those who lost someone they loved at Ground Zero, in the Pentagon or in rural Pennsylvania. Because 9/11 was not only an attack on New York and on the United States. It struck at the heart of the entire world.</p><p> </p><p>For me personally, New York feels like a second home. I have felt this way ever since I first visited the city, in 1989. New York immediately won my heart − got under my skin even. I can’t say exactly why; there’s no one reason. It’s the combination of dynamism and creativity that gives the city such exceptional energy. It’s all the different nationalities that make New York the capital of the world. But perhaps, more than anything, it’s the almost tangible tradition of openness and individual freedom, which you feel each time you arrive there. That still impresses me every time I visit.</p><p> </p><p>But the city never made a deeper impression on me, the New Yorkers never impressed me more, than in the autumn of 2001, a few weeks after 9/11. I was in New York on business and I went to the neighbourhood around Ground Zero. There were still notes and photos hanging everywhere, appealing to people to get in touch. I remember it as if it were yesterday: that incredible sense of unity that held the city together in those weeks. I remember the enormous heaps of rubble where the World Trade Center had stood. I remember the resilience of the people, who despite the pain and despite the grief had already found the courage to look to the future. And what I remember most was the determination of everyone I spoke to, that the terrorists would never be allowed to win.</p><p> </p><p>The Netherlands shared that determination from day one, because the democratic values that we share must never be surrendered to the forces of blind hate and fundamentalism. This is the reason the United States and the Netherlands, together with other countries, continue in our efforts to safeguard peace and security. To combat terrorism, and to promote the freedom and democratic rights of people worldwide. As we have done since 9/11, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and recently in Libya. It’s true, we often face extremely difficult challenges and instant success is rare. And the harsh reality is that terrorism was not defeated immediately after 9/11, as later attacks on Bali, London and Madrid have shown. But we are gaining ground, step by step. Because in the end, tyranny and terrorist violence cannot triumph over people resolved to shape their own destiny.</p><p> </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p> </p><p>We are all ‘citizens of everywhere’. We learned that on 9/11. And we are reminded of it forcefully on an anniversary like today. So it is good, and necessary, for us to continue remembering the victims of 9/11. They deserve that − as individuals. And because they remind us that freedom and democracy demand constant vigilance. It is up to us to honour their memory. And staying vigilant is the best possible way to do it. So that something positive can come from the terrible events of that day: for future generations around the world.</p><p> </p><p>Thank you.</p><p> </p>",0
